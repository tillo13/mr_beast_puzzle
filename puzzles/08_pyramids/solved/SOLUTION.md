## Extraction Method

**Per Community PDF:** Word pyramid extraction

PDF describes:
> "Method: Word pyramid
> E → ER → ERA → RACE → ... → CIRCLEABOUT
> Extract: **AROUND**"

### Word Pyramid Build

Starting with single letter E, each row adds one letter to form new word:
```
E
ER
ERA
RACE
[...]
CIRCLEABOUT
```

Final compound word CIRCLEABOUT contains/implies AROUND.

## Why This is Correct

### 1. Word Length Match
AROUND = 6 letters, matches Position 8 requirement perfectly.

### 2. Meta-Clue Fit
> "EVERY CHALLENGE LEADS TOWARDS [A] LOCATION NAME SOMEWHERE **AROUND** [THE] WORLD"

AROUND works as preposition indicating "all around the world" (global search).

### 3. Thematic Fit
- Video: "I Spent 100 Hours Inside The Pyramids!"
- Pyramids = structures that go "around" (surrounding chambers)
- CIRCLEABOUT = literal synonym for AROUND
- "Pyramidal pleasure" = building words in pyramid shape

### 4. Vault Key Candidate
**Candidate key for P8:** `1-1-1-8-4-4` (from vault rim analysis)

This 6-digit key matches AROUND's 6-letter length.

### 5. Video Cross-Reference
**Global Andrew video (LUFbseO6SoA) frame f027-f029:**
- Slack message: "Sleepover? 🏕️"
- Tent emoji 🏕️ over **pyramids** scene
- Maps to P8 (Pyramids puzzle)

### 6. Community Consensus
PDF marks AROUND as "CONFIRMED" for Position 8.

## TODO: Document Extraction

Need to determine exact method:
1. Complete word pyramid sequence (E → ER → ... → CIRCLEABOUT)
2. How does CIRCLEABOUT extract to AROUND?
3. Does vault key `1-1-1-8-4-4` drive extraction?
4. What's the exact extraction rule?
