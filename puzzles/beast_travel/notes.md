## Site Structure

**Navigation:** Home | Trips By Car | Trips By Horse | Trips By Plane | Trips By Boat

**Mascot:** Roamy the Globe (ROAMY = anagram of MORAY, MAYOR)

**Disclaimer:** "THERE ARE NO PUZZLES HIDING IN THE CODE. -SHANE"

**Footer:** "© NOT A REAL TRAVEL COMPANY" | "Made with ❤ by Lone Shark Games"

## Key Rule (from Boat page)

> "These are all the destinations served by Beast Travel, in all stages of our travelers' journeys. **Names of locations are given in the format of city then country, except in the United States and Canada, where state, province, or territory is used instead of country.**"

---

## Trips By Car (15 destinations)

**Rhyming clue:**
> "A nickname for your destination / But not its name or its translation / To get here you can ride our free bus / Or hire a car to get each…"

The rhyme likely ends in a word rhyming with "bus" — possibly "...rebus" or "...plus."
**Mechanic:** Each 12-letter word encodes a **city nickname** (not the city's actual name or a translation).

## Trips By Boat (crossword grid)

**Rhyming clue:**
> "You can fill in all the spaces / And take a boat to all these places / You'll find our transports shown within / They'll give you all you need to win"

**Mechanic:** A crossword-style fill-in grid with transportation icons (car, horse, plane, boat) placed at specific positions. The grid appears to be a **meta-puzzle** that ties all four trip categories together.

- White squares (⬜) = blanks to fill
- Transportation icons mark crossing points or category indicators
- ~50+ rows of mixed squares and icons
- **This is likely the final extraction puzzle for Stage 2**

---

## Totals

| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Car | 15 |
| Horse | 9 |
| Plane | 16 |
| Boat | Grid puzzle (meta) |
| **Total destinations** | **40 named + boat grid** |

Note: Community says 51 total locations. The 40 named words + 11 crossword countries = 51.

## Solving Mechanics (Community Intel)

### Car = Literal City Nicknames
Per community + official hints: the 12-letter words are NOT ciphers or anagrams. They are **genuine obscure English words that ARE real-world nicknames** for specific cities/locations. You need world trivia knowledge to match them. "Take it literally" — find a real place that actually uses that word as its nickname.

### Horse = Cryptic Clues
"Cryptic" rhyme ending suggests each word functions as a **cryptic crossword clue** — containing wordplay (anagrams, hidden words, charades, etc.) that yields a city name.

### Plane = Visual/Professor-Style
"A picture's worth a thousand words" + "think like a professor" — may involve images on the site associated with each word, or academic/encyclopedic decoding.

### Boat = Integration Meta-Grid
The fill-in grid is where ALL 51 location answers get entered (city, country format). Transportation icons at specific grid positions **index into the filled answers** to extract letters. These extracted letters spell the final vault code. This is the endgame extraction puzzle.

## Connection to Rest of Puzzle

- **50 locations from Stage 1** + **crossword** → Beast Travel
- The 11 soup-country names from the crossword likely correspond to 11 of these destinations
- The Boat grid is likely where you "check in" (Hint #8) — solving it may reveal the final code
- Loyalty program: solving puzzles unlocks more puzzles dynamically

## Open Questions

1. How do the 12-letter words encode city names/nicknames? (Anagram? Hidden word? Cipher?)
2. What do the transportation icons in the Boat grid represent mechanistically?
3. Are there images associated with the Plane destinations (since "a picture's worth a thousand words")?
4. How do the 11 crossword countries map to these 40 destinations?
5. Is EYJAFJALLAJOKULL (community-confirmed answer) one of these, or from elsewhere?
6. Does the Boat grid have a fixed size or is it dynamic?
