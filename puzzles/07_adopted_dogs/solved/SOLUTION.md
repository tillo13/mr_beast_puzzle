## Puzzle Type

**Dog grid / visual identification + Venn diagram**

10×10 grid of 100 dogs. 5 questions:
- Ears up?
- Toy bone?
- Spots?
- Collar?
- Tail?

Venn diagram overlay. Caption: "sixth doggo in sixth row no longer wagging tail"

## Extraction Method

**Per Community PDF:** Venn diagram cipher

PDF describes:
> "Method: Venn diagram cipher
> Community found **SOMEWHERE** (not SOMEBODY)
> Fits meta-clue theme: 'somewhere around the world'"

### Key Insight: SOMEWHERE vs SOMEBODY

**User may have heard:** SOMEBODY (from Slack community / Discord)

**PDF shows:** SOMEWHERE (correct answer)

**Why SOMEWHERE is correct:**
- Fits location theme ("somewhere around the world")
- SOMEWHERE = adverb of place
- SOMEBODY = person reference (doesn't fit location hunt)

### Riddle References

PDF mentions:
- "number in a Spielberg movie" clue
- "Coppola film" clue
- PUPPIES as key word

Exact extraction method not fully documented in our files.

## Why This is Correct

### 1. Word Length Match
SOMEWHERE = 9 letters, matches Position 7 requirement perfectly.

### 2. Meta-Clue Fit
> "EVERY CHALLENGE LEADS TOWARDS [A] LOCATION NAME **SOMEWHERE** AROUND [THE] WORLD"

SOMEWHERE works perfectly as an adverb of place. The instruction reads naturally:
"Find a location name somewhere around the world"

### 3. Thematic Fit
- Video: "I Adopted 100 Dogs!"
- Each dog goes to a new home "somewhere"
- Location-based adoption (geographic placement)
- Venn diagram = set theory = defining regions/places

### 4. SOMEBODY Doesn't Fit
If Position 7 were SOMEBODY:
> "...NAME SOMEBODY AROUND [THE] WORLD"

This is grammatically awkward. SOMEWHERE flows naturally.

### 5. Community Consensus
PDF marks SOMEWHERE (not SOMEBODY) as "CONFIRMED" for Position 7.

## TODO: Document Extraction

Need to determine exact method:
1. How does Venn diagram encode letters?
2. What are the Spielberg/Coppola riddles?
3. How does PUPPIES function as key?
4. Which dogs contribute to extraction?
