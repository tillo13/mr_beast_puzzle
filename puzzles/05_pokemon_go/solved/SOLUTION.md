## Why This is Correct

### 1. Word Length Match
LOCATION = 8 letters, matches Position 5 requirement perfectly.

### 2. Meta-Clue Fit
> "EVERY CHALLENGE LEADS TOWARDS [A] **LOCATION** NAME SOMEWHERE AROUND [THE] WORLD"

LOCATION is the KEY WORD in the meta-clue! This is what the entire puzzle hunt is about — finding a location.

### 3. Thematic Fit
- Video: "POKEMON GO STEREOTYPES"
- Pokemon Go = location-based mobile game
- Players hunt Pokemon at real-world locations
- Perfect thematic match

### 4. Central to Puzzle Hunt
The meta-clue is literally telling you to find a "location name" — having LOCATION as one of the 9 words makes thematic sense.

### 5. Community Consensus
PDF marks LOCATION as "CONFIRMED" for Position 5.
