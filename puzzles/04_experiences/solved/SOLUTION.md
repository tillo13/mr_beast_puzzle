## Why This is Correct

### 1. Word Length Match
TOWARDS = 7 letters, matches Position 4 requirement perfectly.

Note: PDF shows "TOWARDS [A]" where [A] is an article, suggesting the actual answer is 7 letters (TOWARDS) and "A" is added for grammar.

### 2. Meta-Clue Fit
> "EVERY CHALLENGE LEADS **TOWARDS** [A] LOCATION NAME SOMEWHERE AROUND [THE] WORLD"

TOWARDS works perfectly as a directional preposition leading to a location.

### 3. Thematic Fit
- Video: "$1 vs $500,000 Experiences!"
- Experiences lead toward destinations
- "Where did I go?" = directional question
- Place names = locations you go toward

### 4. Community Consensus
PDF lists TOWARDS for Position 4 (though marked as working theory, not fully confirmed).

## TODO: Document Extraction

Need to determine exact method:
1. How do place names combine to spell TOWARDS?
2. Does filename encode extraction key?
3. Which Super Bowl ad element provides the key?
4. Are stencil colors significant?
