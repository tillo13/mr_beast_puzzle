LEADS works grammatically and thematically (challenge leads toward location).

- Cleanup leads to improvement
- Debris removal leads to clean beach
- Strong thematic connection

## TODO: Document Extraction

Need to determine exact method:
1. How do TV shows map to cleanup pairs?
2. What are the "number pairs" in AFTER column?
3. How do removed debris letters contribute?
4. What's the extraction key/pattern?
