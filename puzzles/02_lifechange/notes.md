# Puzzle #2 — LIFECHANGE Sudoku

**Video:** "Changing the Lives of 600 Strangers" (VGvj6bj4Sog)
**Pinned comment link:** Reddit u/BeastForce67
**Puzzle type:** 9x9 Sudoku using letters L-I-F-E-C-H-A-N-G (from "LIFECHANGE") instead of digits 1-9
**Expected answer:** 9-letter word (position 2 in the meta-clue)

## Letter-to-Number Mapping

L=1, I=2, F=3, E=4, C=5, H=6, A=7, N=8, G=9

## Transcription Note

The primary grid transcription from the image had a position error: the F in Row 7 was at column 2, not column 3. The shift variant **R7C3(F) -> C2** produces the correct solution.

There are 9 total solvable single-shift variants, but R7C3(F)->C2 matches the image most closely.

## Status: GRID SOLVED, EXTRACTION METHOD UNKNOWN

The grid is solved, but we still need to know **which cells to read** to get the 9-letter answer word. The extraction key likely comes from:
- The Super Bowl ad (specific visual clue)
- Another puzzle piece
- A future hint

Possible extraction methods to try:
- Read specific row/column/diagonal
- Read cells at specific positions indicated by an ad clue
- Read highlighted/special cells from the original image
- Use a numeric key from elsewhere to select cells
