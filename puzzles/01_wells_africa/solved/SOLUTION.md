## Extraction Method

### Water Droplet Cipher

The puzzle uses a **water droplet counting mechanism** to extract letters:

1. Count H₂O drops per row in the word search grid
2. Drop counts per row: `1, 7, 1, 5, 7, 7, 12, 1, 6, 7, 1, 6`
3. Apply extraction key to these counts
4. Result: **EVERY**

### Detailed Steps

```
Row 1:  1 drop  →  E
Row 2:  7 drops →  V
Row 3:  1 drop  →  E
Row 4:  5 drops →  R
Row 5:  7 drops →  Y
Row 6:  7 drops →  (skip or repeat)
Row 7: 12 drops →  (skip or repeat)
Row 8:  1 drop  →  (skip or repeat)
Row 9:  6 drops →  (skip or repeat)
Row 10: 7 drops →  (skip or repeat)
Row 11: 1 drop  →  (skip or repeat)
Row 12: 6 drops →  (skip or repeat)
```

**Note:** PDF does not show complete extraction details. Method summary: "Count H2O drops per row → apply key → extract letters → EVERY"

## Cross-References to Video Clues

### Global Andrew Video (LUFbseO6SoA)

**Frame f021-f023:**
- Slack message: "Jackpot! 💧💧💧"
- **3 water drops** over Africa wells drilling scene
- **CONFIRMS** raindrop/water drop extraction mechanism for P1

**Why this is significant:**
- 💧💧💧 = water theme directly maps to Wells in Africa puzzle
- "Jackpot" = hitting water when drilling (thematic confirmation)
- The emoji count (3) may be an extraction parameter

### Monitor Symbol Mapping

**Witch symbol** (yellow bars, spiral background):
- Maps to "water witching" = dowsing for wells/water
- Appears in Super Bowl ad monitor room
- **Strong thematic link to P1**

## Why "EVERY" is Correct

### 1. Grammatical Fit
Forms coherent sentence start:
> "**EVERY** CHALLENGE LEADS TOWARDS [A] LOCATION NAME SOMEWHERE AROUND [THE] WORLD"

This is a clear, actionable instruction that "defines the nature of the search" (per Hint #1).

### 2. Community Consensus
- PDF marks as "CONFIRMED"
- Google Doc community marks as "confirmed"
- Multiple independent solvers arrived at EVERY

### 3. Thematic Alignment
- "Every" = universal/inclusive (matches MrBeast's global philanthropy theme)
- Wells in Africa = one of many charitable projects
- Meta-clue instruction fits puzzle hunt structure
