## Puzzle Type
**Drop-quote / acrostic hybrid.** Grid of letters with water-drop blanks (💧 = letter to fill). 13 crossword-style clues below the grid. Fill the blanks using clue answer letters. Complete grid reads L-R, T-B as a quote/message.

## Grid Transcription (Best Effort — NEEDS VERIFICATION)

The grid is 9 rows × ~10 columns. `_` = water drop blank.

```
       C1  C2  C3  C4  C5  C6  C7  C8  C9  C10
Row 1: M   _   R   A   Y   _   _   C   O   N
Row 2: U   A   N   L   _   _   C   S   T   I
Row 3: _   H   D   _   O   A   I   D   A   _
Row 4: N   D   T   R   W   O   _   R   R   _
Row 5: N   E   W   _   P   E   N   A   E   T
Row 6: _   _   C   _   I   I   V   I   N   _
Row 7: P   E   D   B   N   S   _   _   _   C
Row 8: Y   _   O   H   _   K   W   C   _   _
Row 9: T   R   O   R   D   K   _   S   C   _
```

**⚠️ CRITICAL: This transcription is approximate.** Column alignment and exact blank positions need verification against higher-res image. The column count (10 vs 11 vs 13) is uncertain. Agent 2 (grid_analysis) may have a more precise transcription — check that file when it appears.

### Blank Count
~28-30 water drops total.

### Blanks per Column (10-col model)
- C1: rows 3, 6 → 2 blanks
- C2: rows 1, 6, 8 → 3 blanks
- C3: none → 0 blanks
- C4: rows 3, 5, 6 → 3 blanks
- C5: rows 2, 8 → 2 blanks
- C6: rows 1, 2 → 2 blanks
- C7: rows 1, 4, 7, 9 → 4 blanks
- C8: rows 1, 7, 9 → 3 blanks (possibly 8 too)
- C9: rows 8 → 1+ blanks
- C10: rows 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 → 6 blanks

## Clue Solutions

### High Confidence (use these first)
| # | Clue | Answer | Letters | Confidence |
|---|------|--------|---------|------------|
| 1 | A cold noise? | **ACHOO** | 5 | HIGH — wordplay: "a cold" = illness, noise = sneeze |
| 5 | "Rats!" (2 wds.) | **OH NO** | 4 | HIGH — standard crossword answer |
| 6 | A certain Midwesterner | **IOWAN** | 5 | HIGH — classic crossword answer |
| 7 | A child's toy (2 wds., Hyph.) | **YO-YO** | 4 | HIGH — the definitive answer |
| 12 | A literary outlaw (2 wds.) | **ROBIN HOOD** | 9 | HIGH — the most famous literary outlaw |

### Medium Confidence (need grid constraints to verify)
| # | Clue | Answer | Letters | Confidence | Alternatives |
|---|------|--------|---------|------------|-------------|
| 2 | A natural disaster | **FLOOD** | 5 | MEDIUM | QUAKE, STORM |
| 3 | MrBeast went to one in Greenville, NC | **SCHOOL** | 6 | MED-HIGH | ACADEMY, COLLEGE |
| 4 | Deceive | **TRICK** | 5 | MEDIUM | DUPE (4), FOOL (4), CHEAT (5) |
| 8 | Upset | **IRATE** | 5 | MEDIUM | RILED (5), ANGRY (5), MAD (3) |
| 9 | Item in MrBeast's store | **HOODIE** | 6 | MEDIUM | TSHIRT (6), HAT (3) |
| 11 | A type of boat | **CANOE** | 5 | MEDIUM | KAYAK, SKIFF, SLOOP |
| 13 | What you might say when you finish this! | **WELL DONE** | 8 | MED-HIGH | EUREKA (6), VOILA (5) — pun on "wells" is compelling |

### Low Confidence (many possible answers)
| # | Clue | Answer | Letters | Confidence | Alternatives |
|---|------|--------|---------|------------|-------------|
| 10 | A US landmark (2 wds.) | **HOOVER DAM** | 9 | LOW-MED | MT RUSHMORE, GOLDEN GATE, LIBERTY BELL |

### Total letters from best answers: 5+5+6+5+4+5+4+5+6+9+5+9+8 = **76 letters**

This is far more than the ~30 blanks. This means either:
- Answers interlock crossword-style (share letters at crossings)
- Only certain letters from each answer fill into the grid
- The grid is larger than we think
- Some answers are shorter than guessed

## Key Observations

### Acrostic First-Letter Check
First letters of best answers in clue order: A-F-S-T-O-I-Y-I-H-H-C-R-W
Doesn't spell anything obvious. NOT a simple acrostic.

### Visible Word Fragments
- Row 5: "NEW _ PENA _ ET" → possibly "NEW PLANET" (with L filling blank at C9)
- Row 6: "_ _ C _ IIVIN _" → could contain "LIVING" or "GIVING"
- Row 1: "M _ RAY _ _ CON" → could be part of "MANY RAYS" or "MURRAY"
- Row 4: "NDTRWO _ RR" → hard to parse

### The "WELL DONE" Pun
Clue 13 ("What you might say when you finish this!") almost certainly = WELL DONE. It's a water/wells pun and exactly the kind of thematic wordplay Lone Shark Games is known for.

### Puzzle Mechanism Still Unclear
The exact method for placing clue answer letters into grid blanks is unknown:
1. **Column drops** — each clue's letters fill one column's blanks
2. **Numbered transfer** — each letter has a grid position number (acrostic-style)
3. **Interlocking crossword** — answers go across and down, sharing letters
4. **Sequential fill** — letters fill blanks left-to-right, top-to-bottom

Need the grid transcription to be perfectly accurate to determine this.

## Community Intel
- **Nobody has publicly made progress on this puzzle** (as of Feb 9 evening)
- This is the least-discussed of all 9 puzzles
- No clue answers found in any public source
- Lone Shark Games Discord and r/MrBeast may have private progress

## BREAKTHROUGH THEORY: "WELLS IN AFRICA" Acrostic

**"WELLS IN AFRICA" = exactly 13 letters = exactly 13 clues!**

If this is an acrostic puzzle, the first letters of the 13 clue answers spell out something meaningful. The video title is "I Built 100 Wells In Africa" — and WELLSINAFRICA has exactly 13 letters.

### If first letters spell W-E-L-L-S-I-N-A-F-R-I-C-A:

Assuming clue order A-M = left column (1-7) then right column (8-13):

| Pos | Letter | Clue | Revised Answer | Notes |
|-----|--------|------|----------------|-------|
| A | **W** | A cold noise? | **WHEEZE** (6) | A wheeze IS a cold noise — wordplay with ? |
| B | **E** | A natural disaster | **EARTHQUAKE** (10) | The quintessential natural disaster |
| C | **L** | MrBeast went to one in Greenville, NC | **LIBRARY**? **LASER TAG**? | Uncertain — L-word for a place in Greenville |
| D | **L** | Deceive | **LIE** (3) | Clean, short, perfect crossword answer |
| E | **S** | "Rats!" (2 wds.) | **SHUCKS**? **SO SAD**? | Uncertain — 2-word S exclamation |
| F | **I** | A certain Midwesterner | **IOWAN** (5) | ✅ Matches our original answer |
| G | **N** | A child's toy (2 wds., Hyph.) | **NERF GUN**? | Uncertain — hyphenated N-toy |
| H | **A** | Upset | **ANGRY** (5) or **ANNOYED** (7) | Replaces IRATE |
| I | **F** | Item in MrBeast's store | **FEASTABLES** (10) | MrBeast's chocolate brand! Starts with F! |
| J | **R** | A US landmark (2 wds.) | **RUBY FALLS**? **ROCK CITY**? | R-starting 2-word landmark |
| K | **I** | A type of boat | ??? | I-starting boat... not obvious |
| L | **C** | A literary outlaw (2 wds.) | **CAPTAIN HOOK**? **CLAUDE DUVAL**? | C-starting literary outlaw |
| M | **A** | What you might say when you finish this! | **AT LAST**? **AMAZING**? | A-starting exclamation |

### Assessment
- **Strong fits**: WHEEZE (W), LIE (L), IOWAN (I), FEASTABLES (F), ANGRY (A)
- **Needs work**: S for "Rats!", N for hyphenated toy, I for boat, C for literary outlaw, R for landmark
- **Status**: UNCONFIRMED but highly promising. The exact clue order (left-then-right? interleaved? top-to-bottom?) affects which letters map to which clues.

### If confirmed, this changes our approach entirely
Instead of solving the grid first, we solve the clues with the constraint that first letters spell WELLS IN AFRICA, then use the clue answer letters to fill the grid.

## Super Bowl Ad Connection
- Monitor symbol #1 = **Spider** (dark silhouette on blue/purple) — may correspond to this puzzle
- Community decoded: CASH TENT, LASER MIX UP, TRUST AI, DINAMODI from the ad — none linked to P1 yet
- Vault rim numbers may serve as extraction key once grid is solved

## Next Steps
1. **Get precise grid transcription** — this is the #1 blocker. Column alignment must be exact.
2. **Determine puzzle mechanism** — how do 13 answers map to ~30 blanks?
3. **Cross-reference answers with grid** — use letter constraints from visible grid to narrow clue answers
4. **Fill the grid** — once mechanism and answers are known
5. **Extract 5-letter answer word** — using Super Bowl ad key
6. **Check for grid_analysis.md** — Agent B may have written this file
