# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We're all here to solve a million-dollar puzzle. Let's keep it fun and collaborative.

## Standards

**Do:**
- Share clues, theories, and findings openly
- Give credit when building on someone else's work
- Be respectful — disagree with ideas, not people
- Label theories vs confirmed findings clearly
- Help newcomers get oriented

**Don't:**
- Delete or overwrite other people's contributions
- Claim solo credit for collaborative discoveries
- Post spoilers without warning (if you find the final answer, submit it — don't ruin it for others)
- Harass, troll, or gatekeep

## Enforcement

This is a small community project. If someone's being a problem, open an issue or contact [@tillo13](https://github.com/tillo13) directly.

## Scope

This applies to all interactions in this repo — issues, PRs, discussions, and comments.
