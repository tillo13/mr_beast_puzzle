## Confirmed Decoded Elements

### 1. Laser Sequence → "LASER MIX UP"
- Laser door has **26 dots** (= 26 letters of alphabet)
- Laser hits dots in order: **12-1-19-5-18**, then **13-9-24**, then **21-16**
- A=1,B=2 decode: **L-A-S-E-R** = "LASER", **M-I-X** = "MIX", **U-P** = "UP"
- Full message: **"LASER MIX UP"**

### 2. Dollar Bills in Red → "CASH TENT"
- First video frame has dollar bills marked in red
- Decodes to: **"CASH TENT"**

### 3. Bird on Wire → "DINAMODI"

- Produces letters: **D-I-N-A-M-O-D-I**
- Possible anagrams: "I AM DINO", "DOMAIN ID" — interpretation unclear
