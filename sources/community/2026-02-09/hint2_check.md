## Summary

After conducting 10+ web searches across news outlets, social media references, puzzle community sites, and the official Salesforce hub, there is **no evidence that a formally numbered "Hint #2" has been released** as of the late evening of February 9, 2026.

However, several important developments have occurred since the Super Bowl ad aired:

---

## What HAS Been Released (Feb 8-9)

### Hint #1 (Official, from mrbeast.salesforce.com)
Already captured in `/clues/daily_hints/hint_01.md`. This covers:
- 9-word meta-clue structure (word lengths: 5, 9, 5, 7, 8, 4, 9, 6, 5)
- Super Bowl ad contains frame-by-frame clues
- Bank heist teaser requires Super Bowl ad content to solve
- Each playlist puzzle yields one word

### GMA Appearance Hint (Feb 9, ~morning)
MrBeast appeared on Good Morning America and gave a significant public hint:
- **"Look for some numbers in photos that I took at the Super Bowl."**
- This directs solvers to check MrBeast's social media (X/Twitter, Instagram) for Super Bowl photos containing hidden numbers
- Also said: "Watch four videos closely and follow anything that feels off"
- Confirmed Slackbot will eventually activate to help solvers
- Source: https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/mrbeast-drops-big-hint-1m-puzzle-salesforce-super/story?id=129987912

### MrBeast X/Twitter Statement (Feb 9, Monday morning)
- "No one has solved the $1,000,000 puzzle in our Super Bowl ad yesterday."
- "For the record it's very hard and lots of steps."
- "No one is even close to winning it."

---

## What Was Promised for Hint Schedule

From the official FAQ / landing page at mrbeast.salesforce.com:
- The puzzle starts in **"hard mode"** with no walkthroughs
- **"If it's still too hard for you all -- then we'll unleash some serious help."**
- New clues released **daily** if unsolved
- "Tomorrow we'll drop another clue" (stated on the site around launch day)
- **24-hour mark:** Another clue expected
- **48-hour mark:** "More serious help" promised
- Salesforce Slackbot will eventually be activated

### Interpretation
The 24-hour mark from the Super Bowl ad airing (Feb 8, ~6:30 PM ET kickoff, ad in 4th quarter ~9:30 PM ET) would place the expected Hint #2 release around **9:30 PM ET on February 9** or possibly **February 10 morning**. The GMA hint on Feb 9 morning could be considered the "24-hour clue" informally, though it wasn't labeled as a numbered hint.
