2026-02-10 (community decode deep-dive): 30+ web searches + Manifold Markets deep fetch targeting detailed decode methodology for LASER MIX UP, CASH TENT, TRUST AI, DINAMODI. KEY FINDINGS: (1) ALL FOUR DECODES trace to SINGLE Manifold user "Eliza" — no independent verification found. (2) CASH TENT: Bills marked in red, denominations summed per group map to letters via A=1 (C=3, A=1, S=19, H=8, T=20, E=5, N=14, T=20). Groups composed of $1/$2/$5/$10/$20 denominations. Our frame analysis confirms ~10-12 red-bordered bills. PLAUSIBLE but denomination details unverified at 4K. (3) LASER MIX UP: Community claims 26 dots, sequence 12-1-19-5-18/13-9-24/21-16. Our 4K analysis finds only 14 dots/beams. Sequential activation CONFIRMED but specific numbered sequence CANNOT BE REPRODUCED. LOW confidence. (4) TRUST AI: Morse code from "flickering light" — community itself notes "validity issues." No specific frame range or light source identified. LOW-MEDIUM confidence. (5) DINAMODI: Birds-on-wire cipher, well-known geocaching/puzzle cipher. Source image NOT located in our frame catalog. Multiple anagram theories (I AM DINO, DOMAIN ID, DIAMOND I). MEDIUM confidence on decode, purpose unknown. No new community progress found. Written to sources/community/2026-02-10/community_decode_verification.md

No new ARGNet articles beyond initial Feb 8-9 coverage. Communities active on Reddit/Discord/Twitter but NO breakthroughs reported. Contest deadline: April 2, 2026. Our grid-solving approach remains valid since entire community is similarly blocked on extraction. Written to sources/community/2026-02-10/latest_community_check.md
