```

Row 2:  C  .  .  .  I  .  N  .  .
Row 3:  .  .  I  .  .  L  .  F  .

Row 6:  F  .  .  .  N  .  I  .  .
Row 7:  .  .  F  .  .  G  .  I  .
Row 8:  N  .  .  .  L  .  A  .  .
Row 9:  .  C  .  .  .  H  .  N  .
```

## Rules
- 9x9 Sudoku with 3x3 box divisions
- Uses 9 unique letters from "LIFECHANGE": **L, I, F, E, C, H, A, N, G**
- Each row, column, and 3x3 box contains all 9 letters exactly once
- "LIFE" appears vertically on right side, "CHANGE" horizontally on bottom

## Key Insight
Solving the grid is only step 1. You need an EXTRACTION method (from another clue source like the Super Bowl ad) to know which cells to read to get the answer word.
