[2026-02-10] reddit: Day 2 web search check. No new BeastForce67 posts. MrBeast confirmed on X/GMA nobody has solved it ("no one is even close"). GMA hint: "look for numbers in photos I took at Super Bowl." Official Hint #1 released on hub site confirming 9-word meta-clue architecture (5-9-5-7-8-4-9-6-5), ad/bank interdependence, daily hints coming. 60-70M participants. No community breakthroughs indexed. Reddit threads active but no solved puzzles found. Email registration glitch fixed. See 2026-02-10/latest_check.md for full details.
[2026-02-10 late] reddit: Session 10/11 check specifically targeting extraction methods and BeastForce67 updates. Web searches: site:reddit.com "mrbeast puzzle" "extraction", site:reddit.com BeastForce67. RESULT: ZERO results for extraction methods. NO new BeastForce67 posts or comments beyond the 9 puzzle links. Community remains completely blocked on extraction phase. No public discussion of grid solving beyond P2 Sudoku.
[2026-02-11] reddit: MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH — Community assembled consensus meta-clue "EVERY CHALLENGE LEADS TOWARDS LOCATION NAME SOMEWHERE AROUND WORLD" and solved P1 (EVERY via H₂O method), P2 (CHALLENGE), P6 (NAME), working on P5 (Pokemon). BTS photo gallery extensively analyzed: 11 calendar dates, IPESIT license plate claim, whiteboard sequence 51→20→10→10→6, clocks, operating expenses clipboard ("Vault Code Generator Unbreakable"), belt pattern, Rubiks cube, scene marker AO21|MIKE|2, SWISS flag, PC time 12:23, smoke canister text. CRITICAL CONFLICT: Reddit P1=EVERY vs our submitted P1=TITAN. Physical location hunt theory (Newcastle target). Number 73 analysis expanded (Sheldon Cooper, binary palindrome 1001001, morse "best regards"). Braille claims are AI hallucinations (ignore). See 2026-02-11/reddit_community_breakthrough.md and reddit_data_gaps.md for full analysis and action items.
