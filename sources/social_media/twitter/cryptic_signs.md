# Cryptic Sign Messages (from X/Twitter teaser)

People in a hallway holding signs spelling two distinct messages:

## Message 1
> "First I am ash, hanging and burning and roasting and smoking. No condition. Just ash. Maybe exotic."

### Analysis Ideas
- What is "ash" that hangs, burns, roasts, smokes? → ash tree? ash (residue)?
- "Exotic ash" → specific ash tree variety?
- Check for acrostics (first letters)
- Hidden words within sentences

## Message 2
> "I can't see two eyes. Every breath an explosion. Time stopped. Beast. Every culture. You're in for a. Enter all of. Some are."

### Analysis Ideas
- "Two eyes" = "II" (Roman numeral)? "i i"?
- Acrostic check on first letters of each sentence
- Hidden/embedded words
- Truncated phrases: "You're in for a ___" "Enter all of ___" "Some are ___"
