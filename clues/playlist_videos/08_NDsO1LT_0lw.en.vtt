00:00:00.084 --> 00:00:02.937
I somehow have unrestricted access

00:00:02.984 --> 00:00:05.500
to all of the Great Pyramids of Egypt!

00:00:06.674 --> 00:00:08.342
No, this is the coolest
thing I've ever seen.

00:00:08.384 --> 00:00:11.345
We'll be going into the
tombs of ancient pharaohs,

00:00:11.345 --> 00:00:13.875
places that are literally ilegal to enter

00:00:13.906 --> 00:00:16.018
because they're incredibly dangerous.

00:00:16.101 --> 00:00:17.060
What if we fall?

00:00:17.102 --> 00:00:18.019
Oh, yeah, you'll definitely die.

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:21.814
We’ll even be swimming to a secret
underground tomb beneath the pyramids.

00:00:21.814 --> 00:00:22.398
Oh, my God!

00:00:22.481 --> 00:00:25.568
We've only been granted
100 hours to explore,

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.953
and we're gonna start right now!

00:00:28.037 --> 00:00:30.197
Follow me, boys! It's about to be fun.

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:31.866
This is so beautiful.

00:00:31.908 --> 00:00:34.953
Someone 4,500 years ago
put this rock right here.

00:00:34.953 --> 00:00:39.165
Correct, this pyramid dates
back to about 4,500 years old.

00:00:39.207 --> 00:00:43.586
The passageway we're in leads to what
Egyptologists say is King Khufu's tomb:

00:00:43.628 --> 00:00:46.380
the pharaoh who may have
ordered the pyramids to be built.

00:00:48.967 --> 00:00:52.178
This room is called the Grand Gallery.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.388
What percentage of this pyramid
do you think we've seen so far?

00:00:54.513 --> 00:00:56.927
We might never know
the answer to that question.

00:00:57.029 --> 00:00:58.684
That's the coolest way
he could have answered that.

00:00:58.726 --> 00:01:01.061
This next room was the
king's final resting spot.

00:01:01.228 --> 00:01:02.521
As far as we believe, yeah.

00:01:02.605 --> 00:01:03.105
Let's do it.

00:01:08.524 --> 00:01:09.859
Holy crap! Boys!

00:01:10.675 --> 00:01:12.091
What is this?

00:01:12.464 --> 00:01:14.529
4,600 years ago,

00:01:14.615 --> 00:01:17.732
this chamber may have contained
the king's mummified body.

00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:19.568
This is where the pharaoh was buried.

00:01:19.882 --> 00:01:23.511
This is what we believe
is the final resting place.

00:01:23.611 --> 00:01:24.792
Believe? How do we not know?

00:01:24.876 --> 00:01:28.958
I think somewhere inside this
pyramid, there's another chamber

00:01:29.022 --> 00:01:33.497
that we have not found yet that
might have the body of the king.

00:01:33.581 --> 00:01:35.291
You know what? In this
video, we're gonna find it

00:01:35.387 --> 00:01:39.435
because we will literally be exploring
from hundreds of feet below the pyramids

00:01:39.475 --> 00:01:43.646
up to the highest point in the
largest ancient pyramid on Earth.

00:01:44.544 --> 00:01:46.190
That was awesome!

00:01:46.273 --> 00:01:49.755
Before we go explore the other giant
pyramids, I wanna show you guys base camp.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.237
- Yeah!
- This is nice.

00:01:51.321 --> 00:01:52.154
We got a dinner table,

00:01:52.363 --> 00:01:53.763
some tents to sleep in,

00:01:53.993 --> 00:01:54.724
and...

00:01:57.535 --> 00:01:58.107
Okay.

00:01:58.191 --> 00:02:01.279
We even brought lights so you
can see the pyramids from camp.

00:02:01.363 --> 00:02:03.958
That's gotta be the most expensive
nightlight that's ever existed.

00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:06.238
This is the pyramid we're
gonna explore tomorrow.

00:02:06.323 --> 00:02:08.638
I wanna start at 5 a.m.
Everyone get some sleep.

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:12.872
These pyramids were so
technologically advanced for their time

00:02:12.967 --> 00:02:15.787
that some credit them to
a pre-Egyptian civilization,

00:02:15.871 --> 00:02:18.904
while some point to even
crazier theories like aliens.

00:02:18.988 --> 00:02:22.576
But Egyptologists are sure that
they were built by the first Egyptians

00:02:22.615 --> 00:02:24.029
as tombs for their kings.

00:02:24.113 --> 00:02:27.318
And by the end of this video, we're gonna
find out which of these theories is true.

00:02:27.419 --> 00:02:31.029
All right, boys, I hope you're ready
to explore the next pyramid on our list,

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.505
the Pyramid of Khafre.

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:35.155
What is special about this monstrosity?

00:02:35.356 --> 00:02:38.825
Well, this pyramid is how we learned
how the casing of each pyramid look like.

00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.919
This is how they all
looked like at some point.

00:02:41.003 --> 00:02:42.388
That was right after
the aliens built them.

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:43.787
No aliens!

00:02:44.162 --> 00:02:47.451
Rami led us nearly 100 feet
below the Earth's surface,

00:02:47.467 --> 00:02:48.997
deep into Khafre’s pyramid.

00:02:49.081 --> 00:02:52.951
This is a place where hardly anyone
in the modern world has ever been.

00:02:53.068 --> 00:02:56.853
So to be honest, we had no idea
what to expect going down here.

00:02:58.353 --> 00:03:00.267
The ancient Egyptians had cardboard.

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:03.915
We believed that this was the
burial chamber for King Khafre

00:03:03.947 --> 00:03:05.270
for the longest time.

00:03:05.353 --> 00:03:07.079
And now they're using it to store stuff.

00:03:07.736 --> 00:03:10.650
Well, they're restoring the
pyramid, Jimmy. They gotta use tools!

00:03:10.741 --> 00:03:12.533
So that means there's
a real burial chamber.

00:03:12.617 --> 00:03:15.861
Yes. Rami actually took
us to the real resting place

00:03:15.945 --> 00:03:18.486
thought to have once held
the body of King Khafre.

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:19.617
I see a big ceiling.

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:21.767
Dude, we’re deep in this pyramid.

00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:22.787
Here we are...

00:03:23.204 --> 00:03:26.126
...the final burial
chamber of King Khafre.

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:28.236
No, this is the coolest
thing I've ever seen.

00:03:28.431 --> 00:03:30.697
What the heck, bro?!

00:03:30.783 --> 00:03:31.595
What is this?

00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:32.470
Wait.

00:03:32.774 --> 00:03:33.774
Look at the date.

00:03:33.867 --> 00:03:36.283
The graffiti right there is the
guy who discovered this tomb.

00:03:36.926 --> 00:03:38.751
He claims he discovered this tomb, yes.

00:03:38.835 --> 00:03:40.454
This is where the Pharaoh was buried.

00:03:40.538 --> 00:03:43.337
This is the final resting
place for King Khafre.

00:03:43.421 --> 00:03:45.072
Is it disrespectful to lay in there?

00:03:45.156 --> 00:03:48.486
I wouldn't worry about the
disrespect so much as much as

00:03:49.337 --> 00:03:50.189
the curse.

00:03:50.273 --> 00:03:51.423
What does the curse do to you?

00:03:52.267 --> 00:03:53.234
Do you wanna try?

00:03:54.126 --> 00:03:54.642
No.

00:03:54.726 --> 00:03:56.954
All right, let's get out of
here before we get cursed.

00:03:57.038 --> 00:04:00.236
Oh my gosh, that pyramid is insane.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.033
The king's tomb didn't really
answer many of our questions.

00:04:03.117 --> 00:04:06.384
However, the portal to the
underworld deep beneath the pyramids

00:04:06.468 --> 00:04:08.261
could have everything we were looking for.

00:04:08.345 --> 00:04:11.025
This is the tomb of god Osiris,
where very few...

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:11.939
Oh my gosh.

00:04:12.044 --> 00:04:13.049
...humans have ever been.

00:04:13.133 --> 00:04:14.252
What are we doing?

00:04:14.336 --> 00:04:15.424
As you can imagine,

00:04:15.502 --> 00:04:18.549
the god of the underworld's
tomb is pretty deep underground.

00:04:18.633 --> 00:04:19.955
Oh, heck no.

00:04:20.525 --> 00:04:22.554
It really just goes all
the way down there.

00:04:23.224 --> 00:04:24.099
After you, Karl.

00:04:24.217 --> 00:04:26.093
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

00:04:27.141 --> 00:04:29.244
Why is he walking down so-- so nonchalant?

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.926
This is the entrance, Karl.

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.013
Yeah, to the god on the underworld!

00:04:37.468 --> 00:04:38.427
This is a tall ladder.

00:04:38.675 --> 00:04:40.968
It's actually really
deep. Like, if you fall–

00:04:41.052 --> 00:04:42.471
- Oh, yeah, you'll definitely die.
- Yeah.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.143
This is gettin' pretty scary.

00:04:46.257 --> 00:04:47.768
I don't like this anymore.

00:04:47.852 --> 00:04:51.666
And if we weren't already scared
enough, we then came across this.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.468
3,000 year old

00:04:53.584 --> 00:04:54.251
Human.

00:04:54.359 --> 00:04:56.235
Oh my God. 
Why am I still holding this?

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.283
- Dude, is this a part of a skull?
- This is a skull. Yeah.

00:04:58.367 --> 00:04:59.330
Oh, my God.

00:04:59.414 --> 00:05:01.846
When we go down there,
we will be so far underground

00:05:01.948 --> 00:05:04.713
that there's a chance we pass
out due to a lack of oxygen.

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:05.922
Correct.

00:05:06.006 --> 00:05:08.689
Chandler is heading
to Osiris’s resting place.

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:11.085
All right. Here we go.

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:12.588
Oh, I'm in the water.

00:05:18.741 --> 00:05:21.057
You can tell it's– The
air’s pretty thin down here.

00:05:21.141 --> 00:05:23.127
Wait, what is this? Oh,
there’s a rock right here.

00:05:23.211 --> 00:05:24.236
Is this a rock or lid?

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.636
Right in the center of the room
is the sarcophagus of God Osiris.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.973
Right here is supposedly
the gateway to the underworld.

00:05:32.241 --> 00:05:32.791
Yeah.

00:05:32.875 --> 00:05:34.744
So try to get in.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.852
To the underworld?

00:05:35.936 --> 00:05:36.645
Well, yeah.

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:38.005
Screw it, screw it, screw it.

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:38.463
Screw it.

00:05:39.413 --> 00:05:39.994
Oh my God.

00:05:40.078 --> 00:05:43.189
This sarcophagus is allegedly
the portal to the underworld,

00:05:43.243 --> 00:05:46.080
and virtually no humans
have ever been here before.

00:05:46.164 --> 00:05:47.494
- How deep was it?
- Oh, my God!

00:05:47.713 --> 00:05:49.791
Why am I here? 
Why– I’m a YouTuber.

00:05:49.911 --> 00:05:50.408
What are we–

00:05:50.492 --> 00:05:52.924
Look all the way to that
right corner up there.

00:05:53.008 --> 00:05:54.986
That's a shaft that goes
to nobody knows where.

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:56.029
Karl, get up in there.

00:05:56.229 --> 00:05:57.268
Shou– I can go up there?

00:05:57.495 --> 00:05:58.182
Jimmy, don't let him.

00:05:58.266 --> 00:05:59.518
I'm so scared, bro.

00:05:59.748 --> 00:06:01.432
Karl, that's not smart.

00:06:01.594 --> 00:06:04.861
Dude, I'm literally in a tunnel in ancient
Egypt that nobody's ever been before.

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:09.135
No one is crazy enough. Can
you explain to us what's happening?

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:10.736
I'm in a turn in the cave.

00:06:11.095 --> 00:06:12.713
And it's gettin’ thinner.

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:14.970
Dude, I'm literally, like, actually...

00:06:15.008 --> 00:06:17.008
like, actively kind
of stuck in this thing.

00:06:18.697 --> 00:06:20.449
Karl, you're making history.

00:06:20.533 --> 00:06:23.641
I got, like, one inch of clearance, bro.

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:26.954
It's been longer than
the safe limit for oxygen.

00:06:28.082 --> 00:06:29.124
Can we get out?

00:06:29.614 --> 00:06:30.212
I'm ready.

00:06:30.296 --> 00:06:34.008
So before we literally all die and
see the underworld for ourselves.

00:06:34.092 --> 00:06:35.610
There's no gracefully
doing this, is there?

00:06:35.694 --> 00:06:37.403
We got out of there as quick as we could,

00:06:37.487 --> 00:06:40.930
because I want to live long enough to
explore the never-before-seen shafts

00:06:40.978 --> 00:06:42.759
of the Great Pyramid of Giza,

00:06:42.843 --> 00:06:47.181
Where literally less people in modern
times have been than have gone to space.

00:06:50.314 --> 00:06:51.566
Who wants to ride a camel with me?

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:52.401
Let's do it.

00:06:52.671 --> 00:06:53.790
Pet ‘em. Pet ’em.

00:06:53.874 --> 00:06:54.666
He doesn't want it!

00:06:54.783 --> 00:06:56.157
Have you ever been bit by a camel?

00:06:56.241 --> 00:06:56.950
Yes.

00:06:57.034 --> 00:06:57.450
What?

00:06:57.534 --> 00:06:57.910
Yeah.

00:06:57.994 --> 00:06:58.327
Does it hurt?

00:06:58.557 --> 00:06:59.099
Yes.

00:07:00.556 --> 00:07:01.432
I told you!

00:07:01.549 --> 00:07:03.593
Another big day of exploring ahead.

00:07:03.677 --> 00:07:04.915
This is unbelievable.

00:07:04.999 --> 00:07:05.626
Chandler, you good?

00:07:06.838 --> 00:07:07.714
No!

00:07:07.798 --> 00:07:08.915
Pull it. Pull it.

00:07:08.999 --> 00:07:11.134
I can't. 
Give me off this thing, bro.

00:07:12.477 --> 00:07:14.048
Dude, it looks so good.

00:07:14.464 --> 00:07:16.126
This is probably one of
the coolest shots ever.

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:18.368
Me just riding a camel by one
of the Great Pyramids of Egypt

00:07:18.452 --> 00:07:20.602
Bro, this is absolutely insane.

00:07:20.686 --> 00:07:23.891
And now the director of
the entire Giza Plateau

00:07:23.939 --> 00:07:26.423
is joining us for the
third pyramid on our list,

00:07:26.454 --> 00:07:27.977
the Pyramid of Menkaure.

00:07:28.061 --> 00:07:30.696
If you look at the bottom,
you'll still see some of the granite

00:07:30.717 --> 00:07:32.423
from 4,600 years ago remaining.

00:07:32.507 --> 00:07:35.290
Here's an illustration of what
they think it used to look like.

00:07:37.048 --> 00:07:39.929
But now this is all that
remains almost 5,000 years later.

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:42.993
This is my friend Nolan. Can-- can
we send him to go scout up there?

00:07:44.828 --> 00:07:45.371
Yes.

00:07:46.625 --> 00:07:48.586
I got permission to do
something normally illegal.

00:07:48.996 --> 00:07:49.830
Nolan, be careful!

00:07:49.934 --> 00:07:52.398
Can you just, like, started
yelling at Nolan? He'll freak out.

00:07:52.482 --> 00:07:54.798
You don't really get many
opportunities to climb a pyramid.

00:07:54.899 --> 00:07:55.832
I’m gonna take it, bro.

00:07:56.954 --> 00:07:57.665
Get down!

00:07:58.978 --> 00:08:00.235
Get down, now!

00:08:00.319 --> 00:08:01.390
- Get down.
- Down?

00:08:01.474 --> 00:08:02.225
Yes, down.

00:08:02.394 --> 00:08:02.688
All right.

00:08:02.772 --> 00:08:04.040
Nolan, not a bit. You gotta come down.

00:08:04.124 --> 00:08:05.485
- Come on!
- Yeah, I’m going down.

00:08:05.569 --> 00:08:07.071
Get down, now! Yallah!

00:08:07.155 --> 00:08:07.634
Yallah!

00:08:07.718 --> 00:08:09.782
All right. Hey. He's kidding.
Keep going. He’s kidding.

00:08:10.649 --> 00:08:11.970
- Bro!
- That was a joke.

00:08:12.062 --> 00:08:14.446
Oh my God. You had me freakin' out.

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:16.696
Oh my God, I thought I was
gonna get arrested or somethin'.

00:08:16.954 --> 00:08:18.079
Lead the way, sir.

00:08:18.431 --> 00:08:19.306
Let's do it!

00:08:20.271 --> 00:08:21.648
Wait, wait. Point the camera down there.

00:08:21.732 --> 00:08:23.024
Why is it so dark?

00:08:23.269 --> 00:08:24.610
We have switched the light off.

00:08:25.042 --> 00:08:26.085
Oh. Okay.

00:08:26.413 --> 00:08:27.372
That would explain it.

00:08:27.456 --> 00:08:28.412
All right, lead the way.

00:08:28.475 --> 00:08:31.154
The initial descent of the
pyramid took us down a shaft

00:08:31.244 --> 00:08:33.445
over a hundred feet below the ground

00:08:33.529 --> 00:08:35.881
to the very first chamber
in ancient Egyptian history

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:37.164
to have decorative carvings.

00:08:37.248 --> 00:08:37.968
What is this?

00:08:38.052 --> 00:08:40.453
A decoration of false doors.

00:08:40.537 --> 00:08:45.084
We didn't have any decoration inside
any pyramid from the First Dynasty,

00:08:45.091 --> 00:08:45.984
except this one.

00:08:46.068 --> 00:08:48.068
So this was done four,
five thousand years ago?

00:08:48.248 --> 00:08:49.685
Four thousand six hundred years.

00:08:49.769 --> 00:08:52.029
Furthering our journey
deeper into the pyramid,

00:08:52.065 --> 00:08:53.976
the next shaft brought us to Menkaure's...

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:55.521
antechamber!

00:08:56.756 --> 00:08:58.131
There's so much history in here.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.023
What's in that room?

00:08:59.107 --> 00:09:00.576
I can tell you, nothing there.

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:01.364
Have you been up there?

00:09:01.615 --> 00:09:02.420
No.

00:09:02.504 --> 00:09:03.545
Then how do you know nothing's up there?

00:09:03.629 --> 00:09:04.795
Because I can see from here.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:05.910
Oh, yeah.

00:09:05.994 --> 00:09:06.498
You see?

00:09:06.954 --> 00:09:07.912
Just a tunnel. Nothing there.

00:09:07.996 --> 00:09:09.498
- Okay. Yeah, you can see the...
- Yes.

00:09:09.787 --> 00:09:10.834
Always be skeptical.

00:09:10.918 --> 00:09:12.123
The Pyramid of Menkaure,

00:09:12.155 --> 00:09:14.099
known for its complex passageways,

00:09:14.162 --> 00:09:17.810
had one final descending shaft
that led to the burial chamber.

00:09:17.894 --> 00:09:22.886
So this is the king chamber, and it has
a vaulted ceiling to relieve the weight.

00:09:22.989 --> 00:09:24.709
And how did they know
that 5,000 years ago?

00:09:24.793 --> 00:09:26.222
If you can build a pyramid,

00:09:26.306 --> 00:09:27.223
you can build anything.

00:09:27.223 --> 00:09:28.350
You can do anything!

00:09:28.391 --> 00:09:29.529
You can do anything.

00:09:29.726 --> 00:09:31.521
On our way out, I got to thinking,

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.865
why is there three more
pyramids outside next to this one?

00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:36.358
What are these three mini pyramids?

00:09:36.483 --> 00:09:40.069
Menkaure, he got three small
pyramids for the Queens. The wives.

00:09:40.111 --> 00:09:42.974
So Menkaure had three wives.
And these are their tombs?

00:09:43.058 --> 00:09:43.448
Yes.

00:09:43.532 --> 00:09:44.616
Nolan! Come over here. Nolan.

00:09:44.824 --> 00:09:45.908
Oh God.

00:09:45.992 --> 00:09:48.620
If he can have three partners,
you can at least find one.

00:09:48.787 --> 00:09:50.205
It's a work in progress.

00:09:50.318 --> 00:09:52.833
I did discover a mummy.
She's not asking for money.

00:09:52.917 --> 00:09:55.418
She's always listening to
you. Never talk too much.

00:09:55.544 --> 00:09:56.576
It's a good choice for you.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:57.662
Did you just offer me a mummy?

00:09:57.796 --> 00:09:58.310
Yes...

00:09:58.463 --> 00:09:59.964
The things we do to find you love.

00:10:00.092 --> 00:10:01.959
Our time with Ashraf was coming to an end,

00:10:02.043 --> 00:10:04.326
and before he left, I wanted
to hear his take on this.

00:10:04.427 --> 00:10:06.076
So aliens didn't build the pyramids.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:07.826
Aliens?! Come on, don't break my heart!

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:11.538
We have 124 pyramids all over of Egypt!

00:10:11.727 --> 00:10:13.467
So each time I am calling aliens,

00:10:13.498 --> 00:10:15.498
“Come build a pyramid for me.” 
Cannot be like this.

00:10:15.731 --> 00:10:16.565
Egyptians.

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:17.816
- Yeah.
- We are the builders.

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:18.608
Tareq!

00:10:18.692 --> 00:10:19.068
What?

00:10:19.109 --> 00:10:19.984
Don't bring up aliens again.

00:10:20.154 --> 00:10:20.736
You did!

00:10:20.736 --> 00:10:21.310
Egyptians built it.

00:10:21.394 --> 00:10:24.322
If you can build a pyramid,
you can do anything!

00:10:24.364 --> 00:10:25.031
Yeah!

00:10:25.031 --> 00:10:25.574
Let's go!

00:10:26.365 --> 00:10:30.662
And by anything, I guess that
also meant a massive half-human,

00:10:30.803 --> 00:10:33.164
half-lion mountain of a sculpture,

00:10:33.248 --> 00:10:35.240
which I'm sure is crawling with secrets.

00:10:35.264 --> 00:10:36.640
And now we're at this Sphinx

00:10:36.724 --> 00:10:39.857
with Dr. Zahi, the man who
basically found everything here.

00:10:39.963 --> 00:10:42.842
I read online that there's a
temple buried beneath the Sphinx

00:10:42.865 --> 00:10:45.881
filled with gold. And I'm on a
mission to find out... who is right?

00:10:45.965 --> 00:10:48.346
Dr. Zahi, or all the conspiracy
theories on the internet?

00:10:48.388 --> 00:10:49.013
Okay, hear me.

00:10:49.055 --> 00:10:49.681
Yes, sir.

00:10:49.765 --> 00:10:50.318
Help me!

00:10:52.467 --> 00:10:53.184
Is that an entrance?

00:10:53.309 --> 00:10:54.045
Yes.

00:10:54.129 --> 00:10:57.146
I cannot believe I'm entering the Sphinx.
I want to see if that temple's real.

00:10:58.106 --> 00:10:59.274
I'm not sure I’m gonna fit.

00:10:59.441 --> 00:11:00.109
You will.

00:11:00.191 --> 00:11:01.944
Whoa! This is cool.

00:11:02.028 --> 00:11:03.599
All right, let's see if
there's any hidden gold.

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.782
Uh... Zahi, I just see an empty hole,

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:09.287
Then I need you to give
a statement right now.

00:11:10.373 --> 00:11:11.411
I need a statement!

00:11:11.453 --> 00:11:13.545
All right. Zahi, there is
nothing inside the Sphinx.

00:11:13.629 --> 00:11:15.832
Jimmy, you are going to make history.

00:11:15.916 --> 00:11:19.662
And what better way to make history
than by leaving a message for the future?

00:11:19.746 --> 00:11:21.959
How long do you think this
paper will survive down here?

00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:23.474
Thousands of years.

00:11:23.584 --> 00:11:25.049
- Really?
- We will dig it now

00:11:25.133 --> 00:11:27.607
With the letter, can I
bury this gold Swarm?

00:11:27.904 --> 00:11:28.446
Perfect!

00:11:28.637 --> 00:11:29.795
This is worth $10,000.

00:11:30.138 --> 00:11:31.060
Really?

00:11:31.389 --> 00:11:32.646
This is for the future.

00:11:32.823 --> 00:11:33.323
Yo.

00:11:33.558 --> 00:11:35.518
And I guess the internet
conspiracy theories are right,

00:11:35.518 --> 00:11:37.842
because the Sphinx
definitely has gold in it now,

00:11:37.938 --> 00:11:40.315
thanks to the rarest
Swarm in the entire world.

00:11:40.398 --> 00:11:42.776
Guys, I'm trusting you
not to steal this gold.

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:46.060
At this point, I was starting to
wonder what the other boys were doing

00:11:46.154 --> 00:11:47.920
until I heard this sound above me.

00:11:48.461 --> 00:11:50.185
Zahi, do you hear some helicopters?

00:11:53.077 --> 00:11:54.935
I can't believe we're doing this!

00:11:55.019 --> 00:11:57.685
Somehow, the boys convinced
the Egyptian military and government

00:11:57.769 --> 00:11:59.685
to let them fly around in helicopters

00:11:59.776 --> 00:12:01.771
while Zahi and I were
exploring the Sphinx.

00:12:01.855 --> 00:12:02.974
This is an awesome day.

00:12:05.549 --> 00:12:09.344
But the coolest part of this
entire experience is yet to be seen.

00:12:09.428 --> 00:12:11.045
When you take us to the
top of the Great Pyramid,

00:12:11.297 --> 00:12:13.857
you're gonna show stuff on camera
that you've never shown before.

00:12:13.941 --> 00:12:14.920
Amazing things.

00:12:15.004 --> 00:12:15.754
No spoilers!

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:18.352
Bro, this video is gonna keep
getting better as we go on.

00:12:18.436 --> 00:12:20.732
And before we climb
to the top of the pyramid,

00:12:20.816 --> 00:12:23.709
we thought, what better way
to look for more hidden secrets

00:12:23.793 --> 00:12:26.177
than in a place that
almost no one gets to go?

00:12:26.261 --> 00:12:27.240
Rami, where are we?

00:12:27.626 --> 00:12:29.532
We are at the tomb of Iymery,

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:34.209
one of the places that is
completely illegal for people to go in.

00:12:35.286 --> 00:12:36.371
That's why you’re gonna unlock it.

00:12:36.455 --> 00:12:39.728
Before we go in, it's
extremely, extremely important...

00:12:39.872 --> 00:12:40.224
Yeah.

00:12:40.347 --> 00:12:43.153
...not to touch these walls.
Do you hear me, Nolan?

00:12:43.478 --> 00:12:44.253
Loud and clear.

00:12:44.337 --> 00:12:45.427
You should stay out here. Just maybe.

00:12:45.544 --> 00:12:46.382
Hey, Finger Food.

00:12:46.466 --> 00:12:47.403
I will not touch the wall.

00:12:47.501 --> 00:12:49.336
- Finger Food? What does that mean?
- You’re a wall toucher.

00:12:49.467 --> 00:12:50.093
Wall toucher?

00:12:50.134 --> 00:12:51.005
Hey, Butterfingers.

00:12:51.767 --> 00:12:52.392
Ready?

00:12:52.561 --> 00:12:52.880
Yeah.

00:12:52.964 --> 00:12:54.388
I thought I had seen it all,

00:12:54.466 --> 00:12:58.224
but nothing could have prepared me
for what I was about to see in this tomb.

00:12:59.497 --> 00:13:00.552
Guys, come in here!

00:13:01.057 --> 00:13:02.225
Oh, my gosh.

00:13:02.396 --> 00:13:03.489
Oh, this is beautiful.

00:13:03.573 --> 00:13:06.161
This was the tomb of
the high priest at the time,

00:13:06.219 --> 00:13:07.872
which is like the Pope of the time.

00:13:07.956 --> 00:13:11.708
No one is allowed in here
because these colors cannot be hurt

00:13:11.758 --> 00:13:14.013
after surviving 4,600 years.

00:13:14.097 --> 00:13:16.427
This drawing is 4,600 years old?

00:13:16.654 --> 00:13:19.263
-Exactly. 4,600 years old.
- It’s everywhere!

00:13:19.763 --> 00:13:22.653
In tombs like this one, it’s sometimes
more important than the pyramids for us.

00:13:22.735 --> 00:13:25.130
They explain the daily life of Egyptians.

00:13:25.214 --> 00:13:29.857
This is the one we figured out
how ancient Egyptians made wine.

00:13:29.987 --> 00:13:30.362
Really?

00:13:30.685 --> 00:13:32.646
They’re stomping on grapes up here.

00:13:32.679 --> 00:13:35.802
And going through the
process to bottling the wine.

00:13:35.886 --> 00:13:38.435
So this is like a YouTube
video, but 5,000 years ago.

00:13:38.519 --> 00:13:40.021
This is a how-to video.

00:13:40.105 --> 00:13:42.483
Dude, this is the most
beautiful room I've ever been in.

00:13:42.697 --> 00:13:44.198
Wait, Karl. There's more over here.

00:13:44.455 --> 00:13:45.622
Whoa! What is all this?

00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:48.614
These are normal ancient Egyptians
giving all the normal offerings,

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:53.091
&lt;i&gt;ta and henket&lt;/i&gt;, brandy
and beer, to the high priest, Iymery.

00:13:53.183 --> 00:13:54.700
How do you think the high
priest would have reacted

00:13:54.784 --> 00:13:57.979
if they offered season two MrBeast
Labs Swarms that are available now?

00:13:58.063 --> 00:13:59.802
I think Iymery would
very much appreciate it.

00:13:59.886 --> 00:14:02.896
Much like the buzz around
Mr. Beast Labs Swarms season two,

00:14:02.935 --> 00:14:05.333
our fourth day in Egypt
was just getting started.

00:14:05.417 --> 00:14:07.596
We're kicking things off by
going to the Workman’s tomb

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:09.442
and joining an active excavation.

00:14:09.526 --> 00:14:11.536
Today's gonna be a great
day. Let's have some fun.

00:14:12.435 --> 00:14:15.192
The only thing that can make this moment
better is some Feastables chocolate.

00:14:15.276 --> 00:14:16.653
Ooh, wait. For all of us, maybe?

00:14:16.742 --> 00:14:17.826
Yeah, you can look at the pyramids.

00:14:18.068 --> 00:14:20.294
Man, that would hit with
Feastables, though, probably.

00:14:21.521 --> 00:14:23.583
And so, with only 22 hours left,

00:14:23.667 --> 00:14:26.786
I thought we'd upgrade from
camels to something a little faster.

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:28.216
- Alright, Jimmy, you ready?
- Yeah. Floor it!

00:14:29.734 --> 00:14:31.114
This is insane!

00:14:31.694 --> 00:14:32.622
So sick!

00:14:32.706 --> 00:14:33.622
Yeah!

00:14:34.363 --> 00:14:35.544
This is way too much fun.

00:14:35.628 --> 00:14:38.506
Let's go! Crazy being
by the pyramids right now.

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:40.271
Why’d we ever ride camels?

00:14:41.358 --> 00:14:43.151
I feel like I'm in Indiana Jones.

00:14:43.403 --> 00:14:45.567
We are now at the workman's tomb.

00:14:45.651 --> 00:14:46.665
Let's see if we can find one.

00:14:46.749 --> 00:14:49.294
And who better to show us
around the workman's tomb?

00:14:49.378 --> 00:14:51.130
Once again, Doctor Zahi.

00:14:51.214 --> 00:14:54.175
These are the tombs
of the pyramid builders.

00:14:54.258 --> 00:14:55.263
According to Zahi,

00:14:55.328 --> 00:14:58.513
this is literally where the people
who built the pyramids were buried

00:14:58.537 --> 00:15:00.880
over 4,600 years ago.

00:15:00.972 --> 00:15:02.919
In many other tombs, Jimmy,

00:15:03.002 --> 00:15:06.864
you see beautiful paintings.
But these people are poor.

00:15:06.948 --> 00:15:09.216
This is-- this is so beautiful.

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:11.845
This man, his name is
&lt;i&gt;Nephyr Thys&lt;/i&gt;

00:15:12.555 --> 00:15:13.639
And I know what you're thinking.

00:15:13.723 --> 00:15:15.575
Just because the writing on the wall says

00:15:15.615 --> 00:15:17.615
the people who built the
pyramids are buried here,

00:15:17.802 --> 00:15:19.802
it doesn't actually prove that they were;

00:15:19.886 --> 00:15:22.771
and I thought the same
thing until I saw this.

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:23.653
Wait wait, wait.

00:15:23.737 --> 00:15:24.489
Is that what I think it is?

00:15:24.573 --> 00:15:25.198
Is that a skull?

00:15:25.282 --> 00:15:28.497
Zahi, I need to ask you something
because they're gonna question this.

00:15:28.581 --> 00:15:30.060
You did not put this skull here?

00:15:30.144 --> 00:15:33.286
No, no, no. This is the
exact location of the skeleton

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:34.802
From 4,600 years ago?

00:15:34.886 --> 00:15:36.342
Yes. Yes. We have not moved it at all.

00:15:36.426 --> 00:15:37.676
And you're letting me excavate it?

00:15:37.776 --> 00:15:38.607
Is that a spine?

00:15:38.877 --> 00:15:41.591
Yeah. Well, we found out
that all the skeleton here

00:15:41.674 --> 00:15:44.435
of men and women had
a stress on their back.

00:15:44.737 --> 00:15:45.146
Okay.

00:15:45.286 --> 00:15:45.747
Why?

00:15:45.831 --> 00:15:47.122
Because they were moving two-ton blocks?

00:15:47.206 --> 00:15:51.466
Exactly! Very smart guy. 
Those? Nothing.

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:52.028
Yeah?

00:15:52.112 --> 00:15:53.497
You're not say anything!

00:15:53.787 --> 00:15:56.794
And this is why you keep saying
that aliens didn't build the pyramids,

00:15:56.896 --> 00:15:58.528
because the worker's
bodies are literally here.

00:15:58.620 --> 00:15:59.802
This might be the coolest
thing I've ever done.

00:15:59.865 --> 00:16:01.419
Thank you for having me do this, Zahi.

00:16:01.503 --> 00:16:03.739
And tonight, we still have
an insane adventure left.

00:16:03.823 --> 00:16:07.794
We will reveal many secrets
for the first time to the world.

00:16:07.909 --> 00:16:08.909
He's not joking.

00:16:09.168 --> 00:16:13.224
We will literally be ascending to the
highest point inside the Great Pyramid,

00:16:13.314 --> 00:16:16.349
where less than 50 people
in modern history have been.

00:16:16.818 --> 00:16:17.810
This might be the best day ever.

00:16:18.157 --> 00:16:18.911
Perfect!

00:16:19.114 --> 00:16:21.716
But before we ascend to
the top of the Great Pyramid,

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:24.247
we need to recharge our
energy back at base camp.

00:16:24.651 --> 00:16:26.168
Do you know why I
gathered all of you here?

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:27.646
Ancient Egypt?

00:16:28.038 --> 00:16:29.013
More important.

00:16:30.028 --> 00:16:32.505
The season one of Swarms is almost over.

00:16:32.589 --> 00:16:35.349
Right here is every single
Swarm currently in existence.

00:16:35.498 --> 00:16:37.794
And this is the last time
you'll ever see them.

00:16:37.878 --> 00:16:39.122
Are these not the coolest
things on the planet?

00:16:40.059 --> 00:16:40.536
Yes.

00:16:39.223 --> 00:16:39.974
Rami, do you have kids?

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:41.591
Do you think they'll like some of these?

00:16:41.675 --> 00:16:43.739
I think they will obsess
over them for the rest of time.

00:16:43.823 --> 00:16:46.083
Grab whichever ones you're
missing from your collection,

00:16:46.167 --> 00:16:47.614
because once they're
gone, they're gone forever.

00:16:47.698 --> 00:16:48.357
Oh, this is cool.

00:16:48.441 --> 00:16:51.708
You can find Swarms at Walmart,
target and Amazon in the US

00:16:51.763 --> 00:16:53.778
and around the world in top toy retailers.

00:16:53.862 --> 00:16:56.763
The last batch of season one
Swarms are flying off the shelves,

00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:59.122
so make sure you get them
before they're gone forever.

00:16:59.206 --> 00:17:01.763
Do any of you have a hyperchrome?
We only made a thousand of 'em.

00:17:01.847 --> 00:17:03.021
Wait, what, uh-- what is this?

00:17:04.156 --> 00:17:05.255
Okay. Well, Karl took it.

00:17:07.475 --> 00:17:09.247
And now what you've
all been waiting for...

00:17:09.443 --> 00:17:12.739
We're finally going to ascend
to the top of the Great Pyramid.

00:17:12.823 --> 00:17:14.997
This is the part of the pyramid
we're going to be climbing to.

00:17:15.081 --> 00:17:15.927
Wish us luck.

00:17:16.011 --> 00:17:18.489
And to make sure we
explored this entire pyramid,

00:17:18.571 --> 00:17:21.474
our guide suggested that
before we go to the highest point,

00:17:21.505 --> 00:17:23.505
we make a stop at the very lowest point

00:17:23.537 --> 00:17:25.388
hundreds of feet deep below the pyramid.

00:17:25.472 --> 00:17:28.630
Why are we going down this 300ft tunnel?

00:17:28.714 --> 00:17:31.044
Well, you asked for things
that no one else does.

00:17:31.128 --> 00:17:33.364
Why didn’t the pharaohs just
build a nice staircase to the top?

00:17:33.448 --> 00:17:35.739
Because they wanted to protect
their mummies and treasure.

00:17:35.802 --> 00:17:37.200
That's the whole point of a pyramid!

00:17:37.284 --> 00:17:39.450
Pyramids make me
regret being six-foot-five.

00:17:39.534 --> 00:17:40.966
Yeah, dude. That was a stupid choice,

00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:43.224
Bro, look how deep that tunnel goes!

00:17:43.308 --> 00:17:44.849
I hate being tall!

00:17:45.078 --> 00:17:46.896
Please tell me we’re
halfway there. Please.

00:17:47.015 --> 00:17:48.864
- No, nowhere close.
- And he wasn't lying.

00:17:48.981 --> 00:17:51.341
This tunnel kept going
for hundreds of feet.

00:17:51.425 --> 00:17:54.927
But after almost an hour struggling
through these narrow passageways...

00:17:55.011 --> 00:17:55.778
My knees.

00:17:56.284 --> 00:17:57.950
Jimmy, this feels like we're buried alive.

00:17:58.082 --> 00:17:59.927
We finally made it to the bottom.

00:18:00.011 --> 00:18:01.935
Whoa, I can stand!

00:18:02.019 --> 00:18:03.552
Rami, is it normal to be lightheaded?

00:18:03.664 --> 00:18:06.292
Well, you just crawled down over 300ft.

00:18:07.974 --> 00:18:09.466
I have bad knees that hurt.

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:11.982
Whoa. This is pretty huge.

00:18:12.066 --> 00:18:14.364
When we first discovered this, 
we came into here,

00:18:14.412 --> 00:18:17.599
this massive chamber, 
and nothing was found.

00:18:17.683 --> 00:18:18.517
Why was it empty?

00:18:18.601 --> 00:18:19.393
It’s another decoy.

00:18:19.477 --> 00:18:21.849
They went through all this effort
just to create a decoy chamber?

00:18:21.933 --> 00:18:23.286
Correct. Which makes you wonder.

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:25.205
Is the chamber we found the real chamber?

00:18:25.289 --> 00:18:26.248
Is it also a decoy?

00:18:26.332 --> 00:18:30.857
Which would imply that Khufu's body could
still be in here somewhere in the pyramid.

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:34.276
Proving that the pyramids were
built as tombs for the kings of Egypt.

00:18:34.388 --> 00:18:38.630
But this decoy chamber also included
the deepest point in all of the pyramid.

00:18:38.714 --> 00:18:41.232
Guys, I'm gonna be the
person that's gone the deepest.

00:18:42.628 --> 00:18:44.771
I'm at the lowest point of the pyramid!

00:18:44.855 --> 00:18:48.400
And now that we've been to the lowest
point of the pyramid, let's go to the top.

00:18:48.484 --> 00:18:50.583
From here at the bottom-most point,

00:18:50.654 --> 00:18:53.950
the same long passage took us
to where we can meet Doctor Zahi

00:18:54.005 --> 00:18:56.278
and begin our ascent
to the top of the pyramid.

00:18:56.362 --> 00:19:01.005
Now, I need you to choose the
five people that they will go with us.

00:19:01.089 --> 00:19:01.810
Only five?

00:19:01.894 --> 00:19:02.478
Five.

00:19:02.629 --> 00:19:03.614
Who’s staying behind?

00:19:03.957 --> 00:19:04.528
All right.

00:19:04.823 --> 00:19:06.911
Rock, paper scissors. Shoot!

00:19:07.613 --> 00:19:08.411
No!

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:09.755
Hey Nolan, it was nice knowing you.

00:19:09.838 --> 00:19:10.547
Hey. Fair and square.

00:19:10.631 --> 00:19:13.857
And so from there, we somehow
ended up back in the corridor

00:19:13.919 --> 00:19:16.466
we went through on day one
to get to the King's Chamber.

00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:20.075
We started the video off going
down this tunnel; but to end the video,

00:19:20.146 --> 00:19:22.005
we're going to the hidden
chambers up above.

00:19:22.089 --> 00:19:25.896
In the last 5,000 years, less than 50
people that we know of have been up here.

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:27.692
Is this a bad time to
say I'm afraid of heights?

00:19:27.776 --> 00:19:29.528
I couldn't think of a worse
time for you to tell me that.

00:19:29.612 --> 00:19:32.232
And let me tell you, it was
not easy getting up here.

00:19:32.316 --> 00:19:35.255
The top of this ladder led
to another tiny passageway.

00:19:35.339 --> 00:19:36.966
The final hour of the challenge,

00:19:37.052 --> 00:19:39.177
and we're making a journey
to the top of the pyramid.

00:19:40.057 --> 00:19:40.802
This is hard.

00:19:40.981 --> 00:19:43.733
Good, Jimmy. Good boy.

00:19:43.848 --> 00:19:45.442
I’m not gonna lie, I thought
this would be much easier.

00:19:45.526 --> 00:19:46.497
What is this over here?

00:19:46.581 --> 00:19:48.200
We are in the third chamber now.

00:19:48.271 --> 00:19:50.075
We have two under us,

00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:54.146
but the most important one are
room number three, four and five.

00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:55.966
Now room number four.

00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:57.552
All right, let's keep her going.

00:19:57.636 --> 00:19:58.344
Okay. Let's go.

00:19:58.545 --> 00:19:59.838
Chamber number four.

00:20:00.771 --> 00:20:02.060
Karl, look at this.

00:20:03.814 --> 00:20:07.153
We're about to head to
the tippy-top of the pyramid.

00:20:07.237 --> 00:20:09.450
This is now my favorite video ever.

00:20:09.535 --> 00:20:11.739
Isn't it awesome that Nolan’s not here?

00:20:11.911 --> 00:20:14.380
Yeah, that's my favorite
part of this entire thing.

00:20:14.524 --> 00:20:16.419
But anyways, let's head to the top.

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:17.216
Let's do it.

00:20:17.334 --> 00:20:18.083
Oh my gosh.

00:20:18.918 --> 00:20:19.700
Zahi!

00:20:19.784 --> 00:20:20.278
Yes?

00:20:20.362 --> 00:20:21.321
How did you do this?

00:20:21.405 --> 00:20:22.197
I have no idea.

00:20:22.281 --> 00:20:25.958
And just like that, we are now at
the highest point inside the pyramid.

00:20:26.042 --> 00:20:27.060
We made it, Chandler.

00:20:28.574 --> 00:20:30.677
Oh, my gosh, there's so many bats in here.

00:20:33.485 --> 00:20:35.021
This is not how I wanted the video to end!

00:20:35.225 --> 00:20:37.419
We got, like, two minutes left;
and we’re being attacked.

00:20:40.512 --> 00:20:42.200
Jimmy, come here!

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:45.677
This is one of the names of
the gangs who built the pyramids.

00:20:45.769 --> 00:20:53.068
&lt;i&gt;Heber&lt;/i&gt; means "team". &lt;i&gt;Simsu&lt;/i&gt;
means "friends". &lt;i&gt;Cartouche&lt;/i&gt;, Khufu. Khu fu.

00:20:53.193 --> 00:20:56.638
This means “the group
friends/gang of khofu,”

00:20:56.732 --> 00:20:58.686
and that was written 4,600 years ago.

00:20:58.769 --> 00:20:59.505
Exactly.

00:20:59.589 --> 00:21:00.544
Throughout this video,

00:21:00.593 --> 00:21:03.974
we have learned as much as we
could about the origins of the pyramids.

00:21:04.058 --> 00:21:07.067
And the Egyptologists have shown
us the best evidence they could find.

00:21:07.151 --> 00:21:08.294
- Egyptians...
- Yeah.

00:21:08.378 --> 00:21:09.337
...we’re the builders.

00:21:09.421 --> 00:21:12.442
from the workman's tomb to
the skeletons buried nearby,

00:21:12.471 --> 00:21:14.638
which had all been
affected by manual labor

00:21:14.722 --> 00:21:17.739
to looking under the Sphinx
for secret rooms and treasure,

00:21:17.823 --> 00:21:18.630
There’s not aliens down there.

00:21:18.714 --> 00:21:21.364
to researchers, this graffiti
is the nail in the coffin

00:21:21.447 --> 00:21:24.419
for anyone who doubts that ancient
Egyptians built these pyramids

00:21:24.474 --> 00:21:26.067
as tombs for their pharaohs.

00:21:26.151 --> 00:21:28.122
This is the end of our adventure.

00:21:28.214 --> 00:21:30.521
I have no idea why Egypt
