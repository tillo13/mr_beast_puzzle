00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.087
I'm about to show you what a
half $1 million experience looks like.

00:00:04.112 --> 00:00:06.950
I promise this is going
to blow your mind.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.383
In this video, you will find out
why it cost a quarter of $1 million

00:00:11.383 --> 00:00:13.143
to simulate going to space.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.988
Why it costs $50,000 to explore
the depths of our oceans.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:18.801
Whoa!

00:00:18.868 --> 00:00:20.134
It's coming right at us!

00:00:20.134 --> 00:00:22.967
And every other experience
we tried along the way.

00:00:22.967 --> 00:00:26.900
I'm standing on top of the
tallest building in the world!

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:27.709
Oh my God!

00:00:27.767 --> 00:00:31.234
All the way down to the
cheapest experience I could find.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.336
Riding a camel.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.714
How long can I ride
this camel for a dollar?

00:00:34.734 --> 00:00:36.034
One dollar, two minute.

00:00:36.034 --> 00:00:38.568
Deal. That's a
great $1 experience.

00:00:39.934 --> 00:00:40.634
Hold on tight.

00:00:40.634 --> 00:00:42.166
Wait.
Hold on tight, why?

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.601
Oh my God.

00:00:44.634 --> 00:00:47.701
I wanted to ride camels in Egypt,
but they're way more than a dollar.

00:00:47.701 --> 00:00:49.667
So I'm gonna throw
the pyramids up in post

00:00:49.667 --> 00:00:50.333
Yo!

00:00:50.367 --> 00:00:50.701
Yeah.

00:00:50.801 --> 00:00:51.601
It's beautiful.

00:00:51.701 --> 00:00:53.467
Dude, this is a workout
to stay on this thing.

00:00:53.467 --> 00:00:54.901
I mean, I'm so
high up in the sky.

00:00:54.901 --> 00:00:56.467
Now you know what it's
like to be me and Chandler.

00:00:56.501 --> 00:00:57.100
Okay.

00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:59.934
Well, $1 only got us two
minutes and that time is up.

00:01:00.234 --> 00:01:02.116
Let's go have dinner in the sky.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.422
For $10,000, you can
go 3000 feet in the sky

00:01:05.442 --> 00:01:08.630
with a chef who uses this
hot air balloon as her kitchen.

00:01:08.667 --> 00:01:11.334
You can see the shadow from
the balloon over there in the field.

00:01:11.434 --> 00:01:12.068
Dude!

00:01:12.168 --> 00:01:14.618
This is a little higher than I
expected, I'm not gonna lie.

00:01:14.634 --> 00:01:17.767
But this isn't your everyday
dinner at 3000 feet in the air.

00:01:17.791 --> 00:01:21.732
This Michelin star chef uses the
flame from the hot air balloon itself

00:01:21.732 --> 00:01:24.611
to literally cook the food
for the meal she's preparing.

00:01:24.734 --> 00:01:26.000
MrBeast.

00:01:26.267 --> 00:01:26.601
Oh.

00:01:26.634 --> 00:01:29.601
Yo! That's our next
course of food, bro.

00:01:29.667 --> 00:01:31.732
Now, we're about to
have fish that they cooked

00:01:31.732 --> 00:01:33.443
with the fire from the
hot air balloon.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.055
Oh, thank you.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.097
Oh my gosh.

00:01:36.098 --> 00:01:37.131
Jimmy, this is amazing.

00:01:37.131 --> 00:01:41.131
Look how beautiful it is down there.
Such an amazing view while we eat.

00:01:41.167 --> 00:01:43.133
This fish never dreamed
of being this high up.

00:01:43.267 --> 00:01:47.434
If you got an extra ten grand and want
to impress a girl, I would recommend this.

00:01:47.467 --> 00:01:51.241
Every single one of these ten
gourmet courses was phenomenal.

00:01:51.241 --> 00:01:53.761
But I still had one
question I needed to ask.

00:01:53.761 --> 00:01:56.494
As a Michelin star chef, what do
you think of this Feastables bar?

00:01:56.494 --> 00:01:59.728
Very good on balance. And
what I like is the crunch in the chocolate.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.500
Feastables is now Michelin star approved.
The 10K experience was very beautiful.

00:02:03.534 --> 00:02:04.004
Amazing.

00:02:04.004 --> 00:02:06.508
Up next is the 50K
experience and Chandler

00:02:06.508 --> 00:02:09.112
and Karl have no idea what
I have in store for them.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.300
What do you think of the yacht?

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.485
I think it's beautiful.
It's pretty.

00:02:11.834 --> 00:02:12.200
Yeah.

00:02:12.367 --> 00:02:14.367
Do you think it costs
50 grand for the day?

00:02:14.934 --> 00:02:15.767
No.

00:02:15.868 --> 00:02:16.167
Okay.

00:02:16.267 --> 00:02:17.332
So look over there.

00:02:17.756 --> 00:02:20.200
We're gonna go on a
submarine expedition.

00:02:20.234 --> 00:02:21.133
Oh my God.

00:02:21.133 --> 00:02:23.300
You guys ready to explore
the floor of the ocean?

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.767
Yeah!

00:02:24.067 --> 00:02:25.467
Okay, let's do this.

00:02:29.234 --> 00:02:30.234
- What?
- We're not doing that.

00:02:30.267 --> 00:02:31.033
Let's head over.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.601
Okay.

00:02:31.667 --> 00:02:32.601
Come on.

00:02:32.601 --> 00:02:33.334
Yeah!

00:02:33.834 --> 00:02:35.567
Let's go explore the
floor of the ocean.

00:02:35.567 --> 00:02:36.767
- Okay.
- All right.

00:02:36.834 --> 00:02:39.480
This is awesome. Whoa!
I can already see fish.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.843
Look! We haven't
even gone down yet.

00:02:40.901 --> 00:02:41.791
Look it’s a barracuda!

00:02:41.791 --> 00:02:44.123
You guys want to scrape the
floor of the ocean? We can.

00:02:44.256 --> 00:02:45.038
We can do anything.

00:02:45.038 --> 00:02:48.609
We have this entire submarine to
ourselves and can explore whatever we want.

00:02:48.667 --> 00:02:49.834
Let's do everything.

00:02:49.834 --> 00:02:51.801
Except crashing.
We are not allowed to do that.

00:02:51.801 --> 00:02:52.424
Okay.

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:55.240
And to make sure we got the
very best angles down here.

00:02:55.264 --> 00:02:57.760
We paid scuba divers
to follow the submarine.

00:02:57.785 --> 00:03:00.615
Isn't this cool? Let's communicate
with them "Shark behind"

00:03:00.615 --> 00:03:02.777
everyone freak out.
Okay? Start freaking out.

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:06.910
Got'em!

00:03:06.934 --> 00:03:08.755
While we're underwater,
Tareq and Nolan

00:03:08.755 --> 00:03:11.976
are also on a $50,000
safari in Africa.

00:03:12.033 --> 00:03:14.317
And we're gonna see if we see
more cool creatures down here

00:03:14.317 --> 00:03:15.243
than they do over there.

00:03:15.334 --> 00:03:16.367
Spoiler.
We will.

00:03:18.133 --> 00:03:19.133
This is gorgeous.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.868
All right, let's go find
the king of the jungle.

00:03:20.934 --> 00:03:24.134
We cannot leave Africa until we
see a lion. Do you understand?

00:03:24.701 --> 00:03:26.636
I do understand. Why did
you point at me like that?

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.567
Look, look, look.

00:03:27.634 --> 00:03:30.067
Oh, warthog! Yo, it’s Pumba!

00:03:30.067 --> 00:03:30.868
You scared him.

00:03:30.934 --> 00:03:31.767
You scared him.

00:03:31.767 --> 00:03:33.733
I'm sorry, I shouldn't yell.
I was not supposed to yell.

00:03:33.767 --> 00:03:36.489
Zebras! I feel like zebras
would taste good.

00:03:36.513 --> 00:03:39.234
Like if I was a lion, I'd always go
for a zebra. They just look thick.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.133
What?

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.767
Bro, this is so worth $50,000.

00:03:42.901 --> 00:03:45.034
Yeah. This is so
worth Jimmy’s $50,000.

00:03:45.534 --> 00:03:48.701
Wait, Karl, what if instead of
being a ship that's a submarine?

00:03:48.834 --> 00:03:50.334
We're taking this
thing back up again.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.334
Wow, look at how close
we are to those rocks.

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:56.493
Is it okay? How close we are?

00:03:56.567 --> 00:03:57.901
- Yeah, it's okay.
- All right.

00:03:57.934 --> 00:04:01.033
But we weren't the only ones
getting up close and personal.

00:04:01.034 --> 00:04:01.605
Zebras!

00:04:01.605 --> 00:04:04.543
Where are you going? Hey, buddy.
Wait! Don't go. Come back!

00:04:05.267 --> 00:04:07.001
Tareq, let's talk about
the elephant in the room.

00:04:07.002 --> 00:04:08.236
There's two right behind you.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.201
They are unnervingly close.

00:04:10.201 --> 00:04:11.501
They're very close.

00:04:11.526 --> 00:04:13.460
Oh, it's awfully close.
It is coming towards us.

00:04:13.601 --> 00:04:14.968
We just got charged
by an elephant.

00:04:14.968 --> 00:04:16.300
Oh, it's there!

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.577
-It's the coolest thing ever!
-Look at him!

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.534
That thing is a unit.

00:04:21.667 --> 00:04:22.701
That’s my dad.

00:04:25.701 --> 00:04:27.033
This is way cooler
than a submarine.

00:04:27.067 --> 00:04:28.868
I’d rather see this than a fish.

00:04:28.934 --> 00:04:31.101
Also, my heart’s beating
out of my chest right now.

00:04:31.101 --> 00:04:35.430
And that was the 50k experience. What
we have coming up next is even better.

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.734
This thing pales
in comparison to

00:04:37.758 --> 00:04:41.252
the $250,000 zero
gravity experience.

00:04:41.252 --> 00:04:43.677
This company will fly
you up and then nosedive,

00:04:43.677 --> 00:04:47.061
creating a zero gravity
environment inside the plane.

00:04:47.267 --> 00:04:50.767
The $250,000
experience starts now.

00:04:52.167 --> 00:04:52.901
Oh my water!

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.092
Wow. Oh my God!

00:04:55.967 --> 00:04:57.233
I'm upside down!

00:04:57.233 --> 00:04:59.300
Oh my God. Oh, I
can’t stop floating!

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:00.333
Go long!

00:05:08.634 --> 00:05:10.167
Oh, that was awesome.

00:05:10.267 --> 00:05:12.000
Oh my gosh, this is sick!

00:05:12.133 --> 00:05:14.842
On this next drop, we're
gonna race to the other side.

00:05:15.066 --> 00:05:16.067
Turn on zero gravity.

00:05:16.667 --> 00:05:18.968
-Oh, yeah.
-Dude!

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.133
I’m winning!

00:05:20.133 --> 00:05:21.967
I can’t go anywhere!

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.733
Nolan's losing.

00:05:31.334 --> 00:05:32.100
We made it!

00:05:32.733 --> 00:05:33.834
-We made it.
-We won!

00:05:33.834 --> 00:05:34.433
Guys!

00:05:34.434 --> 00:05:37.268
Turns out racing without
gravity doesn't work so well.

00:05:37.292 --> 00:05:39.267
But luckily, Karl
had a better idea.

00:05:39.467 --> 00:05:41.368
I'm gonna test
out a leaf blower.

00:05:42.092 --> 00:05:43.167
All right, wait for it.

00:05:44.467 --> 00:05:45.634
He’s spinning!

00:05:45.701 --> 00:05:46.534
Oh God!

00:05:46.534 --> 00:05:49.367
-He’s actually spinning!
-Stop!

00:05:49.967 --> 00:05:51.334
Oh my God.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.154
And before we turn
the gravity off again.

00:05:53.178 --> 00:05:56.434
We’re gonna try to make some of our
MrBeast Lab Swarms in zero gravity.

00:05:56.467 --> 00:05:57.700
- You ready?
- Yeah.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.367
Nolan, let's
try to make some!

00:06:00.367 --> 00:06:02.538
I created the coolest toys ever.

00:06:02.538 --> 00:06:04.868
All you have to do is
pour water into the tube,

00:06:04.892 --> 00:06:07.476
shake it and you'll find
out which Swarms you got.

00:06:08.167 --> 00:06:09.400
I’m gonna squirt some water.

00:06:09.476 --> 00:06:10.280
Give me some!

00:06:11.334 --> 00:06:13.367
We’re getting swarmed
by these toys right now.

00:06:13.467 --> 00:06:18.167
This isn’t as easy as I thought. Anyways,
there's over 119 Swarms to collect.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.474
You can find Swarms in packs
of five, packs of two and singles

00:06:21.474 --> 00:06:24.448
available at Walmart, Target,
and Amazon in the United States

00:06:24.486 --> 00:06:27.358
and everywhere around the
world at your top toy retailers.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.167
It’s my favorite toy!

00:06:28.167 --> 00:06:29.734
-I’m weightless.
-Go get it at your local Walmart.

00:06:29.734 --> 00:06:32.235
These are the most
exciting toys this holiday season

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:33.543
and they're
flying off the shelves.

00:06:33.601 --> 00:06:34.367
Karl, catch!

00:06:34.367 --> 00:06:36.634
Make sure you buy MrBeast Labs 
before they're sold out.

00:06:36.734 --> 00:06:37.767
That's going to be cool.

00:06:39.634 --> 00:06:40.701
Hold on, Nolan, catch.

00:06:41.601 --> 00:06:42.401
Yeah.

00:06:42.401 --> 00:06:43.402
Body slam!

00:06:45.167 --> 00:06:48.219
I have no idea how the $500,000
experience is going to top this.

00:06:48.243 --> 00:06:49.267
But let's go find out.

00:06:49.467 --> 00:06:53.576
And after going all around
the entire world to film this video...

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.881
We’re at
the $500,000 experience.

00:06:56.901 --> 00:06:58.734
This is the craziest view ever.

00:06:58.734 --> 00:07:02.749
Unlike any spectacle seen
before in the history of mankind,

00:07:02.749 --> 00:07:06.564
my friends and I are about to
see what half a million dollars

00:07:06.564 --> 00:07:11.787
can allow you to experience in the most
luxurious metropolis in the entire world.

00:07:11.968 --> 00:07:17.038
The city of Dubai, a place carved
from the desert but created for pleasure.

00:07:17.038 --> 00:07:19.040
And at the end of
this video, I'm going to become

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.123
one of the few
individuals in history

00:07:21.123 --> 00:07:24.420
to stand on top of the
tallest building in the world.

00:07:24.692 --> 00:07:27.461
We went all out. It is
going to blow your mind.

00:07:27.461 --> 00:07:28.587
Let's go have some fun.

00:07:28.667 --> 00:07:29.767
How are we here?

00:07:29.801 --> 00:07:33.239
So after we found our way
off this 500ft picture frame,

00:07:33.239 --> 00:07:35.745
we made our way over
to this castle of a hotel.

00:07:36.033 --> 00:07:36.767
Wow.

00:07:37.434 --> 00:07:38.767
This is insane.

00:07:38.834 --> 00:07:39.934
Water in our backyard.

00:07:39.968 --> 00:07:42.669
The first two floors of this
hotel room are magnificent.

00:07:42.669 --> 00:07:46.743
But the coolest one, by far, is the
third level that's completely underwater.

00:07:48.334 --> 00:07:49.767
Oh my God!

00:07:50.114 --> 00:07:54.703
Welcome to Atlantis. We love
you all. Except for you, Karl.

00:07:55.067 --> 00:07:55.834
Sorry, man.

00:07:55.859 --> 00:07:58.737
He went into a thing with
sharks just to make fun of me.

00:07:58.762 --> 00:08:01.585
For the record, there is
over 80 sharks in this tank.

00:08:01.677 --> 00:08:05.289
And later in this experience, we're
actually going to be swimming with them.

00:08:05.314 --> 00:08:07.543
And for the cherry on
top to wrap all this up.

00:08:07.592 --> 00:08:08.166
Come on.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.700
We're going to go skydiving.

00:08:10.167 --> 00:08:11.201
No way.

00:08:11.267 --> 00:08:11.900
Yes!

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.855
Dude, falling from thousands
and thousands of feet in the air.

00:08:15.901 --> 00:08:17.834
Don't worry about that.
Let's go race F1 karts.

00:08:17.859 --> 00:08:18.342
Yeah.

00:08:18.367 --> 00:08:21.126
What better place to do so
than at the Dubai Autodrome?

00:08:21.126 --> 00:08:24.055
Home to some of the
fastest cars in the entire city.

00:08:24.255 --> 00:08:26.065
Just grab whatever car
you want. Let's go race.

00:08:26.067 --> 00:08:26.934
- All right.
- Let's go.

00:08:26.968 --> 00:08:29.340
And I called up some of
the biggest local creators

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:31.657
to have a field
day with these supercars.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.596
Let's have some fun.

00:08:36.468 --> 00:08:38.200
They're going so fast.

00:08:38.234 --> 00:08:41.275
And this is just the first of many
experiences we're going to be doing here.

00:08:41.299 --> 00:08:42.467
We are just getting started.

00:08:42.601 --> 00:08:43.800
I'm ready to race!

00:08:45.067 --> 00:08:47.300
We’re about to lap someone.
We're catching up to them.

00:08:47.467 --> 00:08:50.501
Oh no, Jimmy! No, no.

00:08:50.567 --> 00:08:51.667
Come on, grandma.

00:08:51.701 --> 00:08:54.128
I don't think my mom
will be happy watching me race.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.601
I don't think she could
drive slower if she wanted to.

00:08:57.701 --> 00:09:00.634
That's illegal. Okay.
That's like. That's really illegal.

00:09:00.767 --> 00:09:03.634
While my friends and I were
pretending to be race car drivers.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.033
Woo!

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:09.000
Karl was getting ready to drive
an actual Formula level race car.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.634
I look so cool now.
Let's do this thing.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.133
Off to a rocky start.

00:09:21.879 --> 00:09:26.634
Oh my God, I'm driving a formula car!
This is the best day of my life!

00:09:26.801 --> 00:09:28.139
For the price of this
experience,

00:09:28.139 --> 00:09:30.577
we actually got to keep
this brand new Lamborghini.

00:09:30.577 --> 00:09:31.910
I want to enjoy it a little bit.

00:09:34.467 --> 00:09:37.100
In case you were curious,
this bad boy is fast.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.033
Let's go to an NBA game,
all the way in Abu Dhabi.

00:09:40.067 --> 00:09:42.437
But to be honest, guys, I'm
not the kind of guy who likes to drive

00:09:42.437 --> 00:09:45.048
around sports cars and
plus, we cannot find a parking spot.

00:09:45.073 --> 00:09:47.293
So, I'm just going to find
someone to give this thing to.

00:09:47.404 --> 00:09:49.167
Do any of you watch
the MrBeast channel?

00:09:49.334 --> 00:09:49.776
Yup!

00:09:49.801 --> 00:09:52.634
That says subscribed!
Can I just give you this Lamborghini?

00:09:54.334 --> 00:09:55.833
I’d prefer someone
else to have it.

00:09:56.133 --> 00:09:57.767
What? What the
heck just happened?

00:09:57.801 --> 00:09:59.434
Hey, sir.
Security, can you come over here?

00:09:59.601 --> 00:10:01.734
Oh, he’s subscribed!
Can I just give you this Lambo?

00:10:01.767 --> 00:10:02.400
Yeah, please.

00:10:02.467 --> 00:10:04.701
All right, get in. This is
officially your Lamborghini.

00:10:04.767 --> 00:10:06.167
I am actually shaking right now.

00:10:06.234 --> 00:10:07.868
This is why you gotta
make sure you're subscribed.

00:10:07.901 --> 00:10:09.501
I'd hate for you to
lose a Lamborghini.

00:10:09.534 --> 00:10:12.534
Hey, boys. What are you doing?
We got courtside tickets. Enjoy!

00:10:12.767 --> 00:10:13.767
I am so happy.

00:10:13.767 --> 00:10:15.783
With the Lamborghini
now off my hands,

00:10:15.783 --> 00:10:18.343
I gotta sit courtside at a pro
basketball game.

00:10:22.467 --> 00:10:25.801
But instead, it just ended
up turning into a photoshoot.

00:10:25.868 --> 00:10:26.667
Nice to meet you!

00:10:26.667 --> 00:10:28.734
Then afterwards, I
said hi to Steve Harvey.

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:29.940
Nice to finally meet you!

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:30.773
How you feeling?

00:10:30.773 --> 00:10:33.206
I’m doing good!
And after that, Russell Westbrook.

00:10:33.206 --> 00:10:34.340
-Y’all good?
-Good.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.428
And with $200,000 worth
of experiences left to do.

00:10:37.452 --> 00:10:40.340
Up next, we got to take
over a massive water park.

00:10:43.967 --> 00:10:46.734
Somehow in the middle of the
desert, hang out with penguins.

00:10:46.767 --> 00:10:49.801
I heard you're the alpha.
That is an alpha thing to do.

00:10:49.834 --> 00:10:55.370
And since that wasn't enough, I am now in
a giant pool with 80 sharks and stingrays.

00:10:55.394 --> 00:10:58.434
Hello there, sir. Hey! Hey! Come back here!
I was trying to talk to you.

00:10:58.634 --> 00:11:00.067
He's like Buzz Lightyear.

00:11:02.901 --> 00:11:06.834
Whoa! Oh, excuse me, sir.
Yo, we got some...

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.910
I am Aquaman, the
king of the sharks.

00:11:10.034 --> 00:11:12.988
My first decree is the
sharks bite him and not me.

00:11:13.288 --> 00:11:15.342
Agreed? Oh, attack Karl!

00:11:15.442 --> 00:11:16.509
That is a dinosaur!

00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:18.041
I am your leader. Attack him.

00:11:18.041 --> 00:11:20.876
No! That should not exist.

00:11:20.934 --> 00:11:22.872
I think they just
unplugged my oxygen.

00:11:22.896 --> 00:11:25.503
Well, before this guy turns
me into fish food,

00:11:25.627 --> 00:11:28.734
let's go get our own dinner at a restaurant
straight out of the future.

00:11:28.834 --> 00:11:29.701
Hello, everybody.

00:11:29.767 --> 00:11:31.267
Jimmy, you’re sitting there.

00:11:31.334 --> 00:11:32.767
What is this, Jimmy?

00:11:32.834 --> 00:11:35.272
I don't know. I don't
think I've ever sat

00:11:35.272 --> 00:11:37.410
at a restaurant this far
away from my friends.

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:40.978
Gentlemen, prepare yourself
for a once in a lifetime experience.

00:11:43.634 --> 00:11:47.067
We will start with our first
appetizer. Take it in one bite!

00:11:47.133 --> 00:11:48.033
Cheers.

00:11:48.133 --> 00:11:48.767
Cheers.

00:11:48.834 --> 00:11:49.867
What if I don't like it?

00:11:51.591 --> 00:11:52.391
Is it good?

00:11:52.434 --> 00:11:53.233
This is amazing.

00:11:53.234 --> 00:11:54.567
That whole plate
was just that one bite?

00:11:54.634 --> 00:11:55.400
Yeah.

00:11:55.467 --> 00:11:57.834
Okay. Whoa.
What is going on?

00:11:59.934 --> 00:12:00.567
What?

00:12:00.767 --> 00:12:02.033
It's like a
Call of Duty mission.

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:03.000
Am I getting hacked?

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:05.655
I thought this was a
restaurant, not a movie theater.

00:12:05.655 --> 00:12:06.843
I don't know what's going on.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.223
This nine course meal
is surrounded by full 360

00:12:11.223 --> 00:12:14.376
interactive visuals that
change based on the dish.

00:12:14.968 --> 00:12:17.701
Whoa! Wait, does it, oh,
it responds to your touch.

00:12:19.534 --> 00:12:21.001
Boy’s we're now defending Earth.

00:12:21.001 --> 00:12:22.234
I'm impressively bad at this.

00:12:22.234 --> 00:12:24.167
But even though the
room was impressive.

00:12:24.234 --> 00:12:27.300
Dude, they're getting tripped up
on my water right now. Look at that.

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:31.601
It was the one of a kind food and drinks
that made this experience truly unique.

00:12:31.601 --> 00:12:33.601
You can touch
the glass it’ll react with you.

00:12:34.467 --> 00:12:38.229
We got to try nine mouthwatering
courses from freshly caught seafood.

00:12:38.254 --> 00:12:39.234
Whoa!

00:12:39.267 --> 00:12:39.934
Oh my God.

00:12:39.934 --> 00:12:41.701
To golden wagyu burger.

00:12:42.767 --> 00:12:43.634
You approve?

00:12:43.834 --> 00:12:44.200
Oh, yeah.

00:12:44.267 --> 00:12:45.488
Hey, we found
one Chandler likes.

00:12:45.812 --> 00:12:48.833
They even had one final
course specialized just for us.

00:12:49.133 --> 00:12:49.934
Who is that?

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:51.300
Thats Chandler.

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:52.300
That is not...

00:12:53.234 --> 00:12:54.367
Bro, that is not me.

00:12:56.267 --> 00:12:58.200
But anyways, let's keep
the experience going.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:01.586
All we have left before
I literally fall out of the sky

00:13:01.586 --> 00:13:03.972
and climb the
tallest building on earth

00:13:03.972 --> 00:13:07.541
is to test my fear of heights
at a pool suspended in the sky.

00:13:07.665 --> 00:13:09.386
Look at this view.

00:13:09.386 --> 00:13:10.185
Jimmy!

00:13:10.333 --> 00:13:11.567
Oh my God.

00:13:11.567 --> 00:13:12.700
Are you kidding me?

00:13:12.767 --> 00:13:15.601
Whatever you're seeing right
now does not do this justice.

00:13:15.634 --> 00:13:16.367
No way.

00:13:16.367 --> 00:13:21.171
Standing over 600ft in the sky, this
360 degree infinity pool

00:13:21.171 --> 00:13:24.674
gives you a breathtaking view
of every square inch of the city.

00:13:24.674 --> 00:13:25.752
Let's hop on in boys.

00:13:25.752 --> 00:13:26.552
Yeah, I'm getting in.

00:13:26.552 --> 00:13:30.402
That island behind me is man made.
Everything about this is mind blowing.

00:13:30.402 --> 00:13:32.261
Now we're going to stick
this bad boy over the ledge.

00:13:32.261 --> 00:13:33.094
Jesus, man.

00:13:33.167 --> 00:13:34.000
Check out the view.

00:13:34.067 --> 00:13:35.267
Is that not amazing?

00:13:35.467 --> 00:13:36.601
We're on top of Dubai.

00:13:36.734 --> 00:13:39.367
All right, guys. It's time
we fall from the sky.

00:13:42.567 --> 00:13:44.234
Dude, you're
just falling to the Earth.

00:13:44.334 --> 00:13:46.467
No, you're falling to
this manmade island.

00:13:46.634 --> 00:13:48.042
Oh my God,
I'm so scared.

00:13:48.067 --> 00:13:50.399
Buckle up because what
you're about to witness,

00:13:50.423 --> 00:13:52.934
I never thought I’d
do in my entire life.

00:13:52.968 --> 00:13:55.214
Literal maniacs.
Who does this willingly?

00:13:55.338 --> 00:13:57.787
But what would a video
about experiences be

00:13:57.787 --> 00:14:00.574
without attempting to face
one of my biggest fears.

00:14:00.574 --> 00:14:02.052
Falling out of the sky.

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.567
If I don't make this
still upload the video!

00:14:04.667 --> 00:14:07.634
This is getting real. No!

00:14:07.701 --> 00:14:08.767
I have a family!

00:14:08.968 --> 00:14:09.867
Prepare for takeoff.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.300
It’s getting real!
We're going up!

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:12.099
I know.

00:14:12.299 --> 00:14:13.952
I can't believe we're
actually doing this.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000
This is nuts.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.651
What are the odds I die?

00:14:17.009 --> 00:14:17.676
I don't know.

00:14:17.701 --> 00:14:18.634
Oh my God!

00:14:19.267 --> 00:14:20.701
Approaching
ten thousand feet.

00:14:20.734 --> 00:14:21.868
We are so high.

00:14:21.901 --> 00:14:22.667
I'm not ready.

00:14:22.667 --> 00:14:23.534
Jimmy!

00:14:23.634 --> 00:14:24.300
I'm not ready.

00:14:24.364 --> 00:14:25.149
Go! Come on!

00:14:25.174 --> 00:14:25.975
You're going first.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.733
Jimmy, I hate you!
I changed my mind!

00:14:30.534 --> 00:14:34.568
Oh, my God. Yeah!
We're spinning!

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:38.734
Oh, God. I'm scared!

00:14:38.734 --> 00:14:39.634
Bye Jimmy!

00:14:39.634 --> 00:14:40.701
I don't wanna do this!

00:14:52.534 --> 00:14:55.567
Oh my God!
This is terrifying!

00:14:57.334 --> 00:14:58.709
I'm not going!

00:15:04.058 --> 00:15:05.192
How was it?

00:15:05.433 --> 00:15:06.432
I'm scared.

00:15:06.544 --> 00:15:07.176
You're scared.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.301
Yeah. We're still
pretty high up.

00:15:09.438 --> 00:15:11.273
This is probably
my biggest fear ever.

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:14.736
Oh, gosh.
But I did this for you guys.

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:20.134
Okay. I'm not dead.
I'm alive.

00:15:20.167 --> 00:15:22.467
Where’s Chandler?
Did Chandler not jump?

00:15:22.567 --> 00:15:23.601
Where's Chandler?

00:15:23.801 --> 00:15:26.634
Chandler either didn’t jump
or splatted on the ground.

00:15:26.667 --> 00:15:28.267
Oh, God, I hope
he didn’t jump.

00:15:28.334 --> 00:15:30.001
Sorry Jimmy, I’m not doing it!

00:15:30.001 --> 00:15:32.338
Well it’s a good thing I didn't
ask Chandler to join me

00:15:32.338 --> 00:15:35.174
on the biggest experience
of this whole video, because...

00:15:35.174 --> 00:15:36.951
Behind me is the Burj Khalifa,

00:15:36.951 --> 00:15:38.772
the tallest building on
Earth.

00:15:39.835 --> 00:15:43.334
And to wrap up this experience, I'm
going to go stand all the way on top of it.

00:15:43.434 --> 00:15:47.204
The first step of reaching
the peak of this 2700ft building

00:15:47.204 --> 00:15:51.174
is taking a series of
elevators over 160 stories

00:15:51.199 --> 00:15:55.242
into the sky. But as for the
remaining 900ft, I had no choice

00:15:55.366 --> 00:15:58.367
but to climb to the top myself.
This thing is tall.

00:16:00.133 --> 00:16:01.301
That is a lot of ladders.

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:08.734
I underestimated how
hard it is to get up to the top.

00:16:08.834 --> 00:16:11.111
But even after a full hour of climbing,

00:16:11.144 --> 00:16:13.544
there was still a lot of
skyscraper left to go.

00:16:13.767 --> 00:16:17.888
I thought I finally made it to the top,
but there's still a lot left.

00:16:18.712 --> 00:16:22.310
This thing never ends.
Step by step, I started to question

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:24.308
whether I really
wanted to keep going.

00:16:24.367 --> 00:16:26.867
I don't know if I'm going to make it.
Surely we’re almost there.

00:16:30.534 --> 00:16:33.352
Take that as a no. But
despite all this endurance,

00:16:33.576 --> 00:16:37.389
I reminded myself that this was my
moment to be one of the few individuals

00:16:37.389 --> 00:16:41.239
ever to experience standing on
top of the tallest building on Earth.

00:16:41.539 --> 00:16:43.820
I knew there was no turning back.

00:16:43.968 --> 00:16:47.667
Alright. Homestretch!
Woo! Alright.

00:16:49.444 --> 00:16:51.076
I made it!

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:55.270
I'm standing on top
of the tallest building in the world!

00:16:56.294 --> 00:16:58.234
This is insane!

00:16:59.601 --> 00:17:01.234
Holy crap. I'm high up.

00:17:02.734 --> 00:17:04.167
Oh, this is terrifying.

00:17:05.933 --> 00:17:08.734
Oh, I shoudn’t have looked
down that’s scary. I might puke.

00:17:10.258 --> 00:17:13.433
I’ll admit, Feastables tastes better on the
ground, because on the ground

00:17:13.433 --> 00:17:15.950
I'm not on the verge of passing out.
I'm so afraid of heights.

00:17:17.274 --> 00:17:19.663
I find time and time again
that when I face my fears,

00:17:19.687 --> 00:17:22.342
I usually end up enjoying it
and learning a lot about myself.

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.228
I'm very grateful for this
experience, and I would

00:17:24.252 --> 00:17:26.080
encourage you guys to go
outside your comfort zone.

00:17:26.104 --> 00:17:27.743
Do something you
wouldn't normally do.

00:17:27.743 --> 00:17:30.070
I think you'll end up enjoying it
and learn a lot about yourself.

00:17:30.294 --> 00:17:33.670
Thanks for watching! I hope you enjoyed
all the effort we put in this video!

00:17:33.762 --> 00:17:34.952
I love you guys!
