00:00:00.041 --> 00:00:01.251
In just the USA.

00:00:01.251 --> 00:00:04.796
Over 150 million people
have limited transportation.

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:06.673
That's almost
half the population.

00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:08.925
And in even poorer countries
around the world,

00:00:08.925 --> 00:00:11.261
lack of transportation
is even higher.

00:00:11.261 --> 00:00:14.139
A year ago, when we found out
about the shortage of sanitary

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:15.473
drinking water in Kenya,

00:00:15.473 --> 00:00:17.642
we distributed
dozens of Lectric eBikes

00:00:17.642 --> 00:00:18.852
to water deliverymen

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:21.396
who used to push their heavily
loaded bicycles over

00:00:21.396 --> 00:00:24.607
ten miles around the city
just to make $7 a day.

00:00:24.983 --> 00:00:25.984
With their new bikes,

00:00:25.984 --> 00:00:28.778
they are now able to do
a lot more trips per day,

00:00:28.803 --> 00:00:31.798
which leads to significantly
more income for their families.

00:00:32.157 --> 00:00:33.867
You have made work easier.

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:36.786
And after seeing the profound
impact it had on the community,

00:00:36.786 --> 00:00:38.913
we went to our partners
at Lectric eBikes

00:00:38.913 --> 00:00:40.206
to see if they
wanted to help us.

00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:43.209
Seeing how they sponsored 13 of
our Beast Philanthropy videos.

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:44.711
I don't think you'll be shocked
to hear

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:48.757
that they donated $600,000
worth of Lectric eBikes

00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:51.634
We then asked you guys
to nominate a person you knew

00:00:51.634 --> 00:00:54.095
that was in need of life
changing transportation.

00:00:54.095 --> 00:00:55.805
And after receiving
thousands of videos

00:00:55.805 --> 00:00:57.307
of amazing people in need.

00:00:57.307 --> 00:01:00.101
We were so excited to start
giving them away.

00:01:00.101 --> 00:01:02.020
This e-bike
would change my life.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.273
That will help me and my husband
so much.

00:01:05.315 --> 00:01:06.900
We're kicking off this massive

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.943
giveaway
right here in North Carolina

00:01:08.943 --> 00:01:12.547
where Darren will give away
the first of over 600 bikes.

00:01:13.281 --> 00:01:14.407
This is Maria,

00:01:14.407 --> 00:01:16.743
a single mother
of two children who works

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:19.287
 for 14 hours a day
washing dishes only

00:01:19.287 --> 00:01:21.456
to send the little pay
she has back to her

00:01:21.456 --> 00:01:22.791
children in Guatemala,

00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:24.626
who she hasn't seen in years.

00:01:24.774 --> 00:01:26.774
I have been here for a long time.

00:01:27.047 --> 00:01:28.523
It's been 5 years now.

00:01:30.465 --> 00:01:32.258
And on top of her
long working hours,

00:01:32.258 --> 00:01:35.220
she still has to walk
for miles every single day

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.763
just to get to
and from work.

00:01:36.971 --> 00:01:38.973
This is the first of
hundreds of bikes

00:01:38.973 --> 00:01:40.934
that we're going to be
giving away across the country.

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:42.936
And because this is
the first one,

00:01:42.936 --> 00:01:46.648
we're going to surprise Maria
with an extra $5,000 in cash.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.776
Okay, Let's go surprise her.

00:01:50.902 --> 00:01:52.779
We got you a present.

00:01:55.865 --> 00:01:57.575
Maria told us
she donates whatever

00:01:57.575 --> 00:02:00.578
she has left to feed poor kids
from her village back home.

00:02:00.787 --> 00:02:03.456
So on top of the $5,000,
we surprised her

00:02:03.456 --> 00:02:05.667
with an additional
$7,000

00:02:06.104 --> 00:02:08.837
so that she can help her
village in Guatemala.

00:02:08.837 --> 00:02:10.755
With this new bike,
Maria can easily

00:02:10.755 --> 00:02:12.924
get to and from work
in only 10 minutes,

00:02:12.924 --> 00:02:14.968
not being able
to get to work

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:15.969
or to get to school

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:17.470
or to get to your
medical appointments.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.515
It exacerbates the problems
that people face

00:02:20.515 --> 00:02:21.349
and it keeps them

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:23.935
trapped in the circumstances
that they are in.

00:02:23.935 --> 00:02:25.603
Now, if you
thought that was special.

00:02:25.603 --> 00:02:28.022
we still have
599 more to go.

00:02:28.022 --> 00:02:28.898
It’s going to get crazy.

00:02:31.484 --> 00:02:33.278
No way!

00:02:33.278 --> 00:02:34.237
Yes, it is here.

00:02:37.866 --> 00:02:38.825
It looks so good.

00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:41.578
I went super far.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.122
Thank you guys so much.

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:48.418
Now, it was time to meet Conrad.

00:02:48.418 --> 00:02:51.337
Every single day,
he walks a total of 4 hours

00:02:51.337 --> 00:02:53.173
just to get to work and back.

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:54.716
I'm the type of person
that works

00:02:54.716 --> 00:02:58.136
you know, 80 hours a week,
but with me not having

00:02:58.136 --> 00:03:01.598
transportation is hard for me
to even get 40 hours a week.

00:03:01.598 --> 00:03:03.766
I want to own my own business
one day.

00:03:03.766 --> 00:03:06.102
And with me being able
to have transportation,

00:03:06.102 --> 00:03:07.312
it would be easier

00:03:07.312 --> 00:03:10.064
to get to that goal
of owning my own business.

00:03:10.064 --> 00:03:13.026
Conrad’s Story is just
another example of the dire

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:14.736
need for transportation.

00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:19.866
Oh Wow!

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.247
This bike
 will now save Conrad

00:03:26.247 --> 00:03:27.999
3 hours
every single day.

00:03:28.124 --> 00:03:30.210
Because now I
won't be standing still.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.088
I'll be slowly moving forward
to the next goal in my life.

00:03:34.672 --> 00:03:36.216
I can't believe I'm
saying this, but

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:37.550
we still have 400 more to go.

00:03:39.515 --> 00:03:40.530
Thanks!

00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:42.597
Look at this bike.

00:03:42.597 --> 00:03:43.973
So sick.

00:03:45.016 --> 00:03:47.101
Thank you, MrBeast

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:48.645
Thank you so much.

00:03:48.645 --> 00:03:49.229
Thank you very much.

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:50.772
You have no idea
how much it means to me.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:54.776
It’s so smooth.

00:03:54.776 --> 00:03:55.151
Thanks!

00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:55.610
Thank you.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.446
Thank you, this means so much to me.

00:03:58.446 --> 00:04:00.198
We then met
with Amanda and Susan,

00:04:00.198 --> 00:04:03.034
two incredible women from
the Interfaith Refugee Center

00:04:03.034 --> 00:04:04.869
who have dedicated
their entire lives

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:07.330
to support thousands of refugees
and provide them

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.707
with the necessities
they need to live a normal life.

00:04:09.707 --> 00:04:11.960
They've left their culture.
They've left their language.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.378
They've left their families.

00:04:13.378 --> 00:04:16.506
And we see them probably
at one of the lowest points

00:04:16.506 --> 00:04:17.382
of their lives.

00:04:17.382 --> 00:04:20.301
And despite their best efforts,
the lack of transportation

00:04:20.301 --> 00:04:23.471
makes it incredibly difficult
for the refugees to easily

00:04:23.471 --> 00:04:24.806
integrate into society.

00:04:24.806 --> 00:04:27.600
They rely on
volunteers or staff to

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.269
get to the places
they need to go.

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:31.604
Reliable transportation
can change the lives

00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:33.523
of so many of these refugees.

00:04:33.523 --> 00:04:36.067
So we decided to donate
10 Lectric eBikes

00:04:36.067 --> 00:04:36.943
to the refugee center.

00:04:40.446 --> 00:04:43.283
These bikes will enable
the refugees to move around,

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:45.159
get to their jobs,
and even help

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:46.911
integrating
into the communities.

00:04:46.911 --> 00:04:48.037
We've made it pretty far,

00:04:48.037 --> 00:04:50.540
but we still have 200
more bikes to give away,

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.333
which, mind
you, is worth 200 grand.

00:04:52.333 --> 00:04:54.127
And I'm not really sure
why they gave us all these bikes

00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:56.004
for free, shoutout
to Lectric eBikes.

00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:57.213
Let's keep helping people.

00:04:58.673 --> 00:04:59.966
Look at the box

00:05:01.467 --> 00:05:02.677
It’s here.

00:05:02.677 --> 00:05:04.053
Thanks Beast Philanthropy!

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:05.888
Thank you MrBeast.

00:05:05.888 --> 00:05:07.140
Thank you.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.891
I drove it through
like a fort of snow today

00:05:08.891 --> 00:05:09.976
And it did great!

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:11.769
You guys have actually
changed my life.

00:05:11.769 --> 00:05:12.812
I just want to say thank you.

00:05:12.812 --> 00:05:14.439
I can go anywhere
I want now.

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:15.648
Thank you, MrBeast.

00:05:15.648 --> 00:05:16.733
Thank you, MrBeast.

00:05:16.733 --> 00:05:18.318
Thank you, MrBeast.

00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:19.819
And this will help me a ton.

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:21.154
I appreciate it.

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:23.865
I want to thank you
all very, very much.

00:05:23.948 --> 00:05:26.826
And now it was time
for the very last recipient.

00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:28.161
This is Reginald.

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:29.871
He has lived
at this community center

00:05:29.871 --> 00:05:32.123
for 12 years,
helping those in need.

00:05:32.123 --> 00:05:33.875
My daughters
and my grandkids

00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:35.501
are my inspiration.

00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:36.961
If you keep doing good,

00:05:36.961 --> 00:05:38.212
good things
are going to come out of it.

00:05:38.212 --> 00:05:39.297
And although he is making

00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:41.257
a positive impact
on those around him,

00:05:41.257 --> 00:05:43.176
he still has
to walk one hour

00:05:43.176 --> 00:05:46.179
every day to the nearest bus
stop to get to work.

00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:49.223
If I would have
any other sort of transportation

00:05:49.223 --> 00:05:52.226
it would be a blessing
just to keep moving around

00:05:52.226 --> 00:05:53.895
and staying active with myself.

00:05:53.895 --> 00:05:56.314
And I want to be active
for my grandkids.

00:05:56.384 --> 00:05:58.900
A reliable form of transport
can allow Reginald

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.651
to spend more time
with his family.

00:06:00.651 --> 00:06:03.154
What? Wow!

00:06:04.947 --> 00:06:06.199
Thank you so much.

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:07.992
Thank you so much.

00:06:07.992 --> 00:06:11.746
The extraordinarily generous
donation from Lectric eBikes

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:16.000
has enabled us
to give people an opportunity

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.294
to unleash
their full potential with

00:06:18.294 --> 00:06:20.630
something as simple
as transportation.

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.591
Lectric eBikes time and time
again steps up to the plate,

00:06:23.591 --> 00:06:24.759
asks for very little

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:27.011
and just helps us help
as many people as possible.

00:06:27.011 --> 00:06:30.723
And in this video, they gave us
$600,000 worth of bikes.

00:06:30.807 --> 00:06:33.309
If you ever were curious
if a brand actually

00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:35.436
likes helping people
and wants to do good,

00:06:35.436 --> 00:06:37.605
you shouldn't have to wonder
that about Lectric eBikes

00:06:37.605 --> 00:06:40.441
If there ever was a brand
you need to support, it's them.

00:06:40.441 --> 00:06:42.819
Also subscribe
or Darren will cry.

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:44.278
Please don't make me cry.
