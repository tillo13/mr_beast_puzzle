00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:03.303
I just drop this two strangers
off in the middle of the wilderness.

00:00:03.336 --> 00:00:06.272
These two guys have
never met each other in their life.

00:00:06.272 --> 00:00:07.207
Nice to meet you, man.

00:00:07.207 --> 00:00:09.576
Every day that the two of you
survive in the wilderness,

00:00:09.576 --> 00:00:11.277
I'll give you $10,000.

00:00:11.277 --> 00:00:13.513
I hope you brought enough money,
man. We're here for the long run.

00:00:13.513 --> 00:00:14.547
Hey, put that camera down.

00:00:14.547 --> 00:00:15.682
Let's head out.

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:18.318
Take care boys.
This video can make you guys millionaires.

00:00:18.318 --> 00:00:20.186
He's going to be poor
by the time we're out of here!

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:23.223
- I'm Hase.
- Hase, I'm Grizz.

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:24.424
- Nice to meet you, man.
- Grizz?

00:00:24.424 --> 00:00:27.027
All right. You're gonna be my best
friend for the next, however long.

00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:27.761
Starting now.

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:30.430
These guys receive $10,000 everyday

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.199
with the only limit
being how long they can survive.

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:36.036
Which theoretically means
they could win unlimited money.

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:38.271
Dude, if we stay here,
we’re both multimillionaires.

00:00:38.271 --> 00:00:41.007
We are trying to find a camping spot,
build a fire, survive at night.

00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:42.542
I guess we should just set up camp here.

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:43.543
For the rest of the night,

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:45.812
they gathered wood
and went through their supplies,

00:00:45.812 --> 00:00:48.314
We've got approximately five days
worth of food,

00:00:48.314 --> 00:00:49.449
Two things of water.

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:50.617
Looks like a change of clothes.

00:00:50.617 --> 00:00:52.652
some warm jackets and boom,

00:00:52.652 --> 00:00:53.420
a fire starter.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.888
Let’s see if we can get a fire going.

00:00:56.856 --> 00:00:59.292
- Oh, yeah!
- We are good.

00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:00.593
Let’s make beds out of pine needles.

00:01:00.593 --> 00:01:04.030
It won’t be comfortable, but at least
we won’t freeze to death tonight.

00:01:05.598 --> 00:01:06.766
We're alive.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.801
Day two.

00:01:07.934 --> 00:01:11.304
In the morning, I showed up
to give them their first $10,000.

00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:13.206
Boys, how was the first night?

00:01:13.473 --> 00:01:13.907
It was cold.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.241
It’s been 24 hours and

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:16.643
I didn't walk over with ten grand.

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:17.811
You're not gonna ask?

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:19.079
- Yeah, I guess we should, right?
- Yeah.

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:20.213
Okay. Just look up.

00:01:20.213 --> 00:01:22.615
Oh my...

00:01:24.717 --> 00:01:25.585
Here we go!

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.490
Every 24 hours, we're to drop
$10,000 out of a plane for you guys.

00:01:30.523 --> 00:01:33.359
- There's $10,000!
- In a parachuted briefcase.

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:35.095
Catch it! Go catch it! Go- watch out!

00:01:35.128 --> 00:01:36.529
- Bro, this is crazy.
- Okay.

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:38.431
 Bro, we’re going to be so rich
by the end of this video.

00:01:39.065 --> 00:01:40.133
And on top of that money,

00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:41.334
This is your flare gun.

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:43.636
Very careful. Shoot it up in the air.

00:01:43.636 --> 00:01:45.472
The challenge ends for both of you

00:01:45.472 --> 00:01:46.873
and you walk away
with the money you've won.

00:01:46.873 --> 00:01:48.274
So, how long should we stay out here?

00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:50.610
3.6 million for the year is crazy.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.178
Alright, the plan's officially a year.

00:01:52.178 --> 00:01:53.646
We're going to split this in two.
You get this.

00:01:53.646 --> 00:01:54.747
- Yes.
- I get this.

00:01:54.848 --> 00:01:55.949
Now, we can't screw each other over.

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:57.083
But later in this video,

00:01:57.083 --> 00:01:58.985
that plan doesn't exactly work.

00:01:59.052 --> 00:02:01.488
Alright, I feel bad, but I
need to steal that flare gun.

00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:04.390
I just got to shoot this thing,
and I get to be a dad again.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.660
If you fire that flare, I literally
think I'm going to kill you.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.729
Well buddy, you ready to get rich?

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:10.864
Absolutely.

00:02:10.897 --> 00:02:14.234
By day three you could say the boys were
pretty tired of sleeping on the ground.

00:02:15.768 --> 00:02:19.272
So after another 10 grand, they started
work on building their shelter.

00:02:19.272 --> 00:02:21.207
Going to use my jacket
to gather pine needles

00:02:21.207 --> 00:02:22.041
and layer them on the shelter.

00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:24.444
Alright, I found this metal piece
from a kid's swing set,

00:02:24.444 --> 00:02:26.579
and I think it's going to work great
for the roof for our shelter.

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:28.181
Layer one on.

00:02:28.915 --> 00:02:30.750
Here's
a section that we're working on.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.552
You see, it's
got some structural poles.

00:02:32.552 --> 00:02:35.121
We get to use the parachutes
and the cord.

00:02:35.121 --> 00:02:37.223
So we're going to make a rain cover
on our shelter.

00:02:37.223 --> 00:02:38.324
Everyone thinks probably,

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:40.293
 that I'll be the reason we
leave and fail this challenge,

00:02:40.293 --> 00:02:42.695
but this money would
mean college for the kids.

00:02:42.695 --> 00:02:45.598
And then on day four they started looking
for a water source.

00:02:45.598 --> 00:02:46.766
Oh, there's a swamp.

00:02:46.766 --> 00:02:48.268
I would feel safe boiling that.

00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:50.036
Yeah, we gotta be
careful because that stuff

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.971
is full of bacteria
and parasites.

00:02:55.208 --> 00:02:56.376
Just a touch of the swamp.

00:02:56.376 --> 00:02:58.044
Alright, We’re going to bed.

00:02:58.044 --> 00:03:00.446
Hopefully Grizz snuggles up
because it's cold

00:03:00.446 --> 00:03:01.981
and he's big and warm.

00:03:02.215 --> 00:03:04.951
This is like the third day in a row
that we've gotten two hours of sleep.

00:03:04.951 --> 00:03:06.252
It's been so cold.

00:03:06.252 --> 00:03:08.821
If it rained right now,
we'd probably have to go to the hospital.

00:03:08.821 --> 00:03:10.323
But I do it for $10,000.

00:03:10.323 --> 00:03:13.092
And it wasn't just the freezing
temperatures that we're getting to them.

00:03:13.092 --> 00:03:15.128
We're at the end of our supplies.

00:03:15.128 --> 00:03:17.797
Grizz likes to call it a fast,

00:03:17.797 --> 00:03:20.233
which sounds so much nicer
than starving.

00:03:20.233 --> 00:03:23.203
And for the next few days,
the hunger problem didn't get any easier.

00:03:23.503 --> 00:03:26.606
We had a little square of
beef jerky this morning and that's it.

00:03:26.606 --> 00:03:30.410
Jimmy gave us five days worth
of food and it's day nine right now.

00:03:30.476 --> 00:03:31.778
These are Greenbrier leaves.

00:03:31.778 --> 00:03:33.546
Grizz says they're edible, I guess.

00:03:34.847 --> 00:03:35.114
Yeah.

00:03:35.114 --> 00:03:36.349
It was clear by this point

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:38.218
That the boys
were extremely hungry.

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:41.554
But lucky for them, I had a surprise
waiting for them on day 10.

00:03:41.554 --> 00:03:43.690
They've officially survived
ten days.

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.791
- Yeah, brother!

00:03:44.791 --> 00:03:46.292
Bring in the helicopter.

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:47.760
Oh, man.

00:03:47.961 --> 00:03:49.662
I'm nervous dude.

00:03:50.096 --> 00:03:51.631
Oh my gosh.

00:03:51.664 --> 00:03:52.732
To celebrate Day 10,

00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:55.501
brought you guys an additional
ten days worth of food, spices,

00:03:55.501 --> 00:03:58.071
two tarps and everything
you would need to fish.

00:03:58.071 --> 00:04:01.274
All of this for $50,000
of your prize money.

00:04:01.474 --> 00:04:02.842
-You want some beef jerky?
- Yes.

00:04:02.842 --> 00:04:05.078
Don't eat it yet. These beans look good?

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:05.812
- Absolutely.

00:04:05.812 --> 00:04:06.713
He's not kidding.

00:04:06.713 --> 00:04:09.182
This is literally all the
things we would need to fish.

00:04:09.182 --> 00:04:10.750
- 50 grand.
- 50 grand.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:11.985
- Should we talk to them now?
- Yeah.

00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:13.219
- All right.
- All right.

00:04:13.453 --> 00:04:13.953
All right, Jimmy.

00:04:13.953 --> 00:04:15.555
I'll throw in two Feastable bars.

00:04:15.622 --> 00:04:16.589
Yes.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:17.223
Let's do it.

00:04:17.223 --> 00:04:19.492
- Thank you.
- Thanks, Jimmy!

00:04:19.592 --> 00:04:20.460
Thanks, Jimmy.

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:21.761
It's definitely a deal
we had to say yes to.

00:04:22.061 --> 00:04:25.331
That week of food literally cost
as much as my kid's college tuition.

00:04:25.498 --> 00:04:28.735
- Hello!
- Hey!

00:04:28.735 --> 00:04:31.871
Bro, I still can't believe it every time
this money falls out of the sky.

00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:34.407
The food from the crate
will keep them fed for ten days.

00:04:34.407 --> 00:04:36.075
 But if they want to make it a year…

00:04:36.075 --> 00:04:37.410
Alright, the plan is officially a year.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.146
They’ll still need to find
more food in the wilderness.

00:04:40.146 --> 00:04:41.314
So some of you might be wondering,

00:04:41.314 --> 00:04:43.383
Why have they not caught fish?

00:04:43.383 --> 00:04:45.785
 Well, the swamp nearby has no fish in it.

00:04:45.785 --> 00:04:48.855
 What we really need is
moving water that we can fish in.

00:04:48.855 --> 00:04:51.090
And while Hase was
grumbling on about his kids…

00:04:51.157 --> 00:04:53.192
And my two-year-old
doesn't sleep very well either, so...

00:04:53.192 --> 00:04:53.993
This happened.

00:04:53.993 --> 00:04:55.928
I think being a dad-

00:04:56.863 --> 00:04:57.697
What is this?

00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:00.967
This is a creek.
This is not a swamp.

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:02.268
This is actually moving water.

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:05.204
There's fish in here.
Dude, look at this.

00:05:05.204 --> 00:05:06.539
It's like a dock.

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:08.808
This is the perfect place
for food and shelter.

00:05:08.808 --> 00:05:12.512
And after another few days full
of a surprise freezing rainstorm...

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.649
Rain. At least now we have
a hundred thousand dollars.

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:17.717
They decided to move

00:05:17.717 --> 00:05:20.887
and upgrade their shelter
near their new found water source.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.056
Good morning, Grizz.

00:05:23.056 --> 00:05:24.357
How are you always up earlier than me?

00:05:25.558 --> 00:05:27.260
We're
gathering up a bunch of dead trees

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:28.661
that we can do for our structure.

00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:31.364
And then we balanced them together
into an A-frame shape

00:05:31.364 --> 00:05:33.099
and cut the trees to the right length.

00:05:37.036 --> 00:05:37.737
I'm sorry.

00:05:37.737 --> 00:05:39.372
No, it's all right.
I'm glad I broke your fall.

00:05:39.772 --> 00:05:40.273
Sorry.

00:05:40.273 --> 00:05:42.241
All right,
so maybe they had a bit of a false start,

00:05:42.241 --> 00:05:45.678
but once they got the structure back up,
they spent the entire next day

00:05:45.712 --> 00:05:47.747
putting their finishing
touches on their shelter.

00:05:47.747 --> 00:05:50.883
They even built a fishing dock
to help them catch more food.

00:05:50.883 --> 00:05:52.418
- Docks done.
- Pleasantly surprised.

00:05:52.418 --> 00:05:54.854
And now all we got to do
is catch a fish.

00:05:55.722 --> 00:05:57.023
- Come on. Right?
- Yeah.

00:05:57.023 --> 00:05:58.324
And as good as was this may be

00:05:58.324 --> 00:06:01.794
without sleeping bags, the winter
night was still unforgiving.

00:06:01.828 --> 00:06:03.463
Another  really cold night.

00:06:03.463 --> 00:06:06.065
Cold toes, cold feet. No sleeping bag.

00:06:06.065 --> 00:06:08.067
So I think I knew what my next offer was.

00:06:08.067 --> 00:06:10.470
It's Day 20 and they moved
super deep in the woods

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.071
so now we have to get there by boat.

00:06:12.071 --> 00:06:14.407
- You hear that sound in the distance?
- What'd you say?

00:06:15.007 --> 00:06:15.575
Is that a boat?

00:06:15.575 --> 00:06:17.443
Any minute now, when we find them,

00:06:17.443 --> 00:06:18.978
I've got a fun offer for them.

00:06:18.978 --> 00:06:19.679
How's it going, boys?

00:06:19.912 --> 00:06:21.748
- Hey, Jimmy!
- Hey, guys. What's going on?

00:06:21.748 --> 00:06:24.450
Two things. First,
the plane needed maintenance,

00:06:24.517 --> 00:06:25.885
so I'm delivering this by hand.

00:06:25.918 --> 00:06:27.587
- Hey, all right.
- Here's your $10,000,

00:06:27.687 --> 00:06:30.123
which puts you guys at $140,000.

00:06:30.156 --> 00:06:31.824
And second, we have an offer for you.

00:06:33.493 --> 00:06:34.694
Reveal your offer.

00:06:34.694 --> 00:06:36.796
Just go ahead.
Take it off. Here it is. Ooh.

00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:41.634
You can either give me $10,000
for that red sleeping bag

00:06:41.634 --> 00:06:44.604
or give me $50,000
and you get both sleeping bags.

00:06:44.637 --> 00:06:46.839
- What?
- Five times the amount for both.

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:48.074
Oh, man.

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:49.542
- Can I take it out?
- Yeah. Look at it.

00:06:49.609 --> 00:06:50.643
Yeah. Check them out.

00:06:50.643 --> 00:06:52.011
Hang on. I just got to do this.

00:06:52.745 --> 00:06:55.148
These are the same sleeping
bag we used in Antarctica.

00:06:55.148 --> 00:06:57.350
They work very well.
Here's the weather forecast.

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:58.785
It's going to get pretty cold
next week,

00:06:58.785 --> 00:07:00.853
so I highly recommend
you at least buy one.

00:07:00.853 --> 00:07:04.791
When we started this thing out,
we were in the twenties without anything.

00:07:04.991 --> 00:07:06.159
We've adapted to it.

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:08.294
We have bedding, we have pine straw.

00:07:08.294 --> 00:07:10.630
We're doing pretty well
in these low temperatures.

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:12.298
I would love to have a sleeping bag.

00:07:12.298 --> 00:07:13.900
But $50,000 is...

00:07:13.966 --> 00:07:16.569
I sleep closer to Grizz
than I do my wife, so...

00:07:17.203 --> 00:07:18.337
I'm not even kidding.

00:07:18.337 --> 00:07:20.072
You're actually going to say no
to both?

00:07:21.541 --> 00:07:22.942
A really cold night.

00:07:23.209 --> 00:07:24.277
No sleeping bag.

00:07:24.777 --> 00:07:26.813
Yeah, so I think- I think it's final.

00:07:26.813 --> 00:07:27.346
We don't want it.

00:07:27.346 --> 00:07:29.949
- Yeah. Agreed.
- Not even a single sleeping bag.

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:31.083
All right, boys, close it up.

00:07:31.083 --> 00:07:33.286
Sure the boys could survive
without sleeping bags,

00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:35.321
 but that didn’t solve their food problem.

00:07:35.321 --> 00:07:38.858
In between sitting out rainy days,
the boys go into a bit of a routine

00:07:38.891 --> 00:07:41.327
where they would boil water,
work on their shelter,

00:07:41.327 --> 00:07:44.330
and try to catch fish,
which wasn't really working out for them.

00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:45.832
We've got some guts for bait

00:07:45.832 --> 00:07:48.534
and we're going to cast them out,
and hopefully the fish

00:07:48.534 --> 00:07:50.403
come off the bottom of the creek.

00:07:50.403 --> 00:07:53.306
Day after day of failing
to catch any fish...

00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:56.209
Let's go check the lines.
See if any catfish are on.

00:07:56.209 --> 00:07:58.544
They finally caught a wind
in their sails.

00:08:01.814 --> 00:08:02.515
Grizz!

00:08:02.849 --> 00:08:05.952
Or whatever that
abomination of Mother Nature was.

00:08:06.219 --> 00:08:07.720
What is that?

00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:09.455
Can I eat it?

00:08:10.256 --> 00:08:10.990
First fish.

00:08:11.624 --> 00:08:14.393
It's an eel and I think I'm gonna
charcoal grill it.

00:08:14.393 --> 00:08:17.263
We're going to have ourselves
some American style unagi.

00:08:17.263 --> 00:08:21.033
This is the first thing that
we've caught out here in 27 days,

00:08:21.033 --> 00:08:22.201
which is insane.

00:08:22.201 --> 00:08:24.370
We're happy to have it, and
we're going to make it delicious.

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:25.738
I don't know
if this is what I call delicious,

00:08:26.138 --> 00:08:29.509
but the fact that they haven't
had a fresh meal in almost 30 days

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:31.911
means even a rock would
taste good to them at this point.

00:08:33.713 --> 00:08:34.447
It's excellent.

00:08:34.447 --> 00:08:35.314
It's so good.

00:08:36.115 --> 00:08:38.484
It's really.
It's just, like, amazingly good.

00:08:38.484 --> 00:08:41.454
If we keep catching fish like this
we can easily stay for a year, bro.

00:08:41.454 --> 00:08:43.422
Dude, yeah. 3.6 million dollars.

00:08:43.422 --> 00:08:44.257
Good night.

00:08:44.257 --> 00:08:45.291
And on Day 28,

00:08:45.291 --> 00:08:48.361
they started constructing the raised
bed system in their new shelter.

00:08:48.394 --> 00:08:49.762
So it's going to be two tripods.

00:08:49.795 --> 00:08:51.931
One, two. Side rails going down.

00:08:51.931 --> 00:08:56.502
Slats across, and then a nice pine needle
mattress made out of parachutes.

00:08:56.502 --> 00:08:59.672
And after seeing their new shelter
become more and more comfortable,

00:08:59.672 --> 00:09:01.474
I was starting to get worry
that I was going to pay

00:09:01.474 --> 00:09:03.209
these guys millions of dollars.

00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:06.345
The only regret that I have,
they're not bunk beds.

00:09:07.179 --> 00:09:08.214
that's honestly an L.

00:09:08.214 --> 00:09:09.448
They were betting everything

00:09:09.448 --> 00:09:11.684
on their new shelter
being right next to this creek.

00:09:11.684 --> 00:09:13.419
But that may have been
a huge mistake

00:09:13.419 --> 00:09:16.222
because they couldn't catch another
eel to save their lives.

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:18.791
Snapped it.

00:09:19.325 --> 00:09:21.861
At this point I've spent more time
in the wilderness

00:09:21.861 --> 00:09:23.696
than I have with my newborn son.

00:09:23.763 --> 00:09:26.065
I also have a two year old
with my wife alone.

00:09:26.198 --> 00:09:27.500
How do you explain to a two year old

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.969
that daddy's going to be gone
and he won't talk to you,

00:09:29.969 --> 00:09:31.537
he won't call you
and he won't see you.

00:09:32.605 --> 00:09:34.073
Say they were making us an offer,

00:09:34.073 --> 00:09:36.342
What would be something
that you would actually buy?

00:09:36.342 --> 00:09:39.345
We spend a lot of time out here
trying to get firewood.

00:09:39.345 --> 00:09:42.048
You know, having firewood
dropped off would be really nice.

00:09:42.048 --> 00:09:43.382
I'd probably pay $10,000 for that.

00:09:43.382 --> 00:09:45.918
We are literally
in the middle of the forest.

00:09:45.918 --> 00:09:48.888
I couldn't tell you where we are
anymore. Oh, right.

00:09:48.888 --> 00:09:49.855
How's it going, boys?

00:09:49.855 --> 00:09:51.390
- Doing great, man. How are you?
- Yeah.

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:55.394
As a reward for surviving an
entire month, I brought you a store.

00:09:55.461 --> 00:09:56.329
Oh, okay.

00:09:56.329 --> 00:09:58.197
We combed through
all your vlog footage,

00:09:58.197 --> 00:10:00.700
and we wrote down everything you've
asked for it, such as firewood,

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:05.237
a shovel, cooking supplies, bedding,
and even books and board games.

00:10:05.237 --> 00:10:07.707
It's like a dollar store,
but everything costs $10,000.

00:10:07.707 --> 00:10:09.075
Oh, man.

00:10:09.075 --> 00:10:11.210
This is your store. Feel free to shop.

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:13.479
We’ve won 240 grand.
Might as well check it out.

00:10:13.479 --> 00:10:14.313
- What are these?

00:10:14.313 --> 00:10:15.548
Those are mosquito nets.

00:10:15.581 --> 00:10:17.850
We'll use parachutes. We don't need those.

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:18.751
All right, what about the hammocks?

00:10:18.751 --> 00:10:20.052
I like the hammocks, but,

00:10:20.052 --> 00:10:22.188
you know, we haven't tried
making them out of parachutes yet.

00:10:22.188 --> 00:10:23.089
All right, Grizz, answer this.

00:10:23.089 --> 00:10:24.457
What do you can you not make out
of parachutes?

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:25.057
A lot.

00:10:25.057 --> 00:10:26.626
Okay, well,
do you guys want the firewood?

00:10:26.626 --> 00:10:29.028
- How much wood?
- That's the wood you get.

00:10:29.428 --> 00:10:31.530
If it came with unlimited wood,
I would buy it.

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:34.433
I offer them literally everything
they could possibly need here,

00:10:34.433 --> 00:10:36.068
and they still weren't interested.

00:10:36.068 --> 00:10:37.336
I was beginning to think these two

00:10:37.336 --> 00:10:39.372
were secretly
Navy Seals or something.

00:10:39.372 --> 00:10:41.107
Are you guys going to buy
literally anything?

00:10:41.107 --> 00:10:42.942
You make ten grand a day.

00:10:42.942 --> 00:10:43.909
What's another ten grand?

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:46.412
- I got to say no.
- All right.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:48.981
In a million years,

00:10:48.981 --> 00:10:51.984
would not have thought
they would say no to everything.

00:10:52.151 --> 00:10:54.487
Next time I'm
going to convince you to spend money.

00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:56.389
- We're looking forward to.
- Yeah, man. See you, Jimmy!

00:10:57.123 --> 00:10:59.625
- There he goes.
- In his tank.

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:02.194
Stop right here.
I have a special surprise for all of you.

00:11:02.194 --> 00:11:03.829
Nolan, what does this look like?

00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:04.630
A lot of phones.

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:06.699
A thousand phones to be exact.

00:11:06.699 --> 00:11:08.901
Because over the next seven days,
I'm going to be giving

00:11:08.901 --> 00:11:10.736
a thousand random people
that subscribe

00:11:10.736 --> 00:11:13.072
a free Samsung Galaxy S24.

00:11:13.072 --> 00:11:15.741
I literally spent over
$1 million on these phones,

00:11:15.741 --> 00:11:17.043
and I'm giving them away to you.

00:11:17.043 --> 00:11:19.512
All you have to do to enter to win
one of these phones is subscribe.

00:11:19.512 --> 00:11:20.646
It's literally free.

00:11:20.646 --> 00:11:22.281
I just want you to know
I appreciate everything

00:11:22.281 --> 00:11:23.616
you guys have been doing
for the channel.

00:11:23.616 --> 00:11:25.284
It means the world to me. Subscribe.

00:11:25.284 --> 00:11:26.952
Win one of these phones. Let's go.

00:11:26.952 --> 00:11:29.955
And so they continued without
any of the tools from my offer.

00:11:29.989 --> 00:11:31.357
But go figure,
for the next few days,

00:11:31.357 --> 00:11:33.259
they weren't able to catch any fish.

00:11:33.259 --> 00:11:35.594
And even though
the money kept coming,

00:11:35.594 --> 00:11:38.597
they were running out of food
and time to catch it quickly.

00:11:38.664 --> 00:11:41.033
I am on the last belt loop.

00:11:41.033 --> 00:11:44.170
I think that we have maybe two days
or something worth of food left.

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:45.838
That's not good. Without a boat,

00:11:45.838 --> 00:11:47.673
this creek is not productive.

00:11:47.673 --> 00:11:49.408
We got to go to that river.

00:11:49.408 --> 00:11:52.211
If I can get to that river
and the fishing is good,

00:11:52.211 --> 00:11:53.312
that'll turn all this around.

00:11:53.312 --> 00:11:55.848
With their rations
running dangerously low,

00:11:55.848 --> 00:11:57.783
their only hope of
getting food was to travel

00:11:57.783 --> 00:11:59.485
through the swamp
to the river

00:11:59.485 --> 00:12:02.421
on the other side in hopes
of catching some fish.

00:12:02.421 --> 00:12:05.958
It's risky wasting all these
calories, but I have to do it.

00:12:06.492 --> 00:12:07.927
If we're going to make it any further.

00:12:07.927 --> 00:12:09.662
But after a grueling hike,

00:12:09.662 --> 00:12:11.864
Hase finally found what he was
looking for.

00:12:11.864 --> 00:12:13.199
Oh my gosh.

00:12:13.199 --> 00:12:15.301
Oh, look at that.

00:12:15.301 --> 00:12:16.569
It's the river.

00:12:16.569 --> 00:12:18.604
Is that not the most gorgeous thing
you've ever seen?

00:12:20.906 --> 00:12:23.142
Finding this river is probably
the difference between us

00:12:23.142 --> 00:12:25.244
making our goal
and us tapping out early.

00:12:25.244 --> 00:12:27.513
Fortunately, he had a secret weapon.

00:12:27.513 --> 00:12:29.248
Grizz
and I made our own fishing pole.

00:12:29.248 --> 00:12:31.851
This thing is going
to make catching fish easy.

00:12:34.887 --> 00:12:37.890
With Hase's makeshift fishing
pole immediately breaking,

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:41.627
he was going to have to use
his hands and he spent hours trying,

00:12:42.161 --> 00:12:42.962
and failing.

00:12:42.962 --> 00:12:43.629
Oh, no.

00:12:43.629 --> 00:12:46.532
And If he couldn't catch any fish
without immediately dropping them,

00:12:46.532 --> 00:12:49.535
the calories burned coming here
would be for nothing.

00:12:49.869 --> 00:12:51.637
But just when he was ready to give up...

00:12:51.637 --> 00:12:52.872
This is going to be it.

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:54.940
Yeah.

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:55.975
Holy moly.

00:12:56.842 --> 00:12:58.778
Yes, I told you it was that one!

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.048
And the luck didn't stop there.

00:13:03.048 --> 00:13:05.084
I cannot wait to bring this back
to Grizz.

00:13:05.084 --> 00:13:06.786
He's going to be so stoked.

00:13:08.654 --> 00:13:09.588
We're eating tonight!

00:13:09.655 --> 00:13:11.223
Hey!

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:12.725
All right, that's awesome.

00:13:12.725 --> 00:13:15.261
Feels like
this is our first real food in ages.

00:13:15.261 --> 00:13:17.329
But in the meantime,
I was preparing an offer

00:13:17.329 --> 00:13:18.831
that I know they couldn't refuse.

00:13:18.831 --> 00:13:19.732
It's day 40.

00:13:19.732 --> 00:13:22.134
They've made over a third of $1
million.

00:13:22.134 --> 00:13:24.103
And I have an incredibly special for them.

00:13:24.103 --> 00:13:25.571
For $10,000,

00:13:25.571 --> 00:13:27.306
and I think that you're really going
to like this.

00:13:27.306 --> 00:13:28.607
You both can see your wives.

00:13:28.607 --> 00:13:30.075
In fact, they're watching right now.

00:13:30.075 --> 00:13:32.211
- Do it! Do it!
- Oh my God, guys. Are you serious?

00:13:32.211 --> 00:13:32.812
Oh, man.

00:13:32.812 --> 00:13:35.314
- I can't let down my kid.
- I know. I can't let down my wife.

00:13:35.314 --> 00:13:36.048
Okay, Jimmy.

00:13:36.348 --> 00:13:37.383
Yes!

00:13:37.983 --> 00:13:38.851
Yeah!

00:13:38.851 --> 00:13:39.318
Oh, yeah.

00:13:39.318 --> 00:13:40.719
- Yes!
- Oh my God.

00:13:40.886 --> 00:13:42.388
It's me, it's daddy.

00:13:42.388 --> 00:13:44.790
- Oh, my God.
- I smell so bad.

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:45.724
Hi, Talia.

00:13:45.724 --> 00:13:48.127
As nice as it was to see
their families,

00:13:48.127 --> 00:13:49.662
the visit was also bittersweet

00:13:49.662 --> 00:13:52.531
because there's one big question
on everyone's mind.

00:13:52.531 --> 00:13:55.534
How long do you want us to stay?

00:13:55.868 --> 00:13:57.903
I want you home now.

00:13:57.903 --> 00:13:59.505
Like, I do.

00:14:00.339 --> 00:14:01.607
I know you want me home.

00:14:01.607 --> 00:14:02.741
But do you need me home?

00:14:03.209 --> 00:14:04.643
Yes, she needs you.

00:14:05.244 --> 00:14:07.580
Yes. You need to bond with your son.

00:14:08.614 --> 00:14:10.349
I don't care what the other guy
says.

00:14:10.616 --> 00:14:12.051
You've made enough money.

00:14:12.051 --> 00:14:13.085
I need you home.

00:14:15.721 --> 00:14:18.557
That conversation was so difficult
for me.

00:14:19.124 --> 00:14:22.394
Even so,
yesterday was a really good day.

00:14:22.394 --> 00:14:24.063
It had all of the things
that I love.

00:14:24.063 --> 00:14:27.266
It had my family, my wife,
my kids, my buddy Grizz.

00:14:27.499 --> 00:14:30.102
That was like a really huge gift.

00:14:30.102 --> 00:14:30.970
But they're gone now.

00:14:32.805 --> 00:14:35.140
To hold her and know that she was safe.

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:38.544
It really has changed the way that
I'm viewing this entire challenge.

00:14:38.577 --> 00:14:40.145
Knowing I have my wife's support.

00:14:40.145 --> 00:14:42.348
I want to stay
until I have $1 million.

00:14:42.615 --> 00:14:44.717
And after some much needed family time,

00:14:44.717 --> 00:14:46.952
Hase and Grizz were much
happier than I'd ever seen.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.989
Hase and Grizz, Grizz, Grizz.

00:14:49.989 --> 00:14:52.124
- Hase and Grizz, Grizz, Grizz.

00:14:52.157 --> 00:14:52.958
Ambush!

00:14:53.926 --> 00:14:55.127
Let's smoke some fish.

00:14:55.127 --> 00:14:57.563
Look at that. This is perfect.

00:14:57.563 --> 00:14:58.631
Even when something happened

00:14:58.697 --> 00:15:00.699
that would've totally drained
them before...

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:02.401
$400,000.

00:15:02.401 --> 00:15:04.603
By now, they didn't even seem to mind.

00:15:04.603 --> 00:15:06.572
It looks like someone had a gender
reveal.

00:15:06.572 --> 00:15:08.207
And the gender was just money.

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:11.210
Even though their spirits were high,
there was still a problem

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:12.144
they needed to solve.

00:15:12.244 --> 00:15:13.879
In order to get to the river to fish,

00:15:13.879 --> 00:15:16.548
they would first need to trudge
through this giant swamp.

00:15:16.548 --> 00:15:17.917
But if they had a boat,

00:15:17.917 --> 00:15:21.253
they'd easily be able to float down
the creek to the river.

00:15:21.253 --> 00:15:22.655
I'm building a boat.

00:15:22.655 --> 00:15:24.957
The idea is to create a frame
with sticks

00:15:24.957 --> 00:15:27.359
and then attach our tarp
so the whole thing can float.

00:15:27.359 --> 00:15:30.162
I'm not feeling super confident
in the boat build.

00:15:30.162 --> 00:15:32.097
If we can get down to fish

00:15:32.097 --> 00:15:33.899
without having to tromp
through a whole swamp,

00:15:33.899 --> 00:15:34.600
it's worth the risk.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.970
Time for the first sea
trial of my beautiful ship.

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:39.939
- Here he goes.
- Grizz!

00:15:42.608 --> 00:15:44.009
And this was pretty ironic

00:15:44.009 --> 00:15:46.145
considering the offer
I was about to bring them.

00:15:46.845 --> 00:15:48.013
It's day 50.

00:15:48.013 --> 00:15:49.214
Let's see how they're doing.

00:15:49.214 --> 00:15:49.648
- Hey.
- What's up?

00:15:49.648 --> 00:15:51.483
Oh, you guys have a village now.

00:15:51.483 --> 00:15:53.085
Wait, are you serious? You built a boat?

00:15:53.085 --> 00:15:53.719
Yeah, man.

00:15:53.719 --> 00:15:56.021
You're telling me this
thing can actually float?

00:15:56.021 --> 00:15:58.324
- You want to try it?
- Yeah, I don't... I...

00:15:58.457 --> 00:16:00.459
Oh, my gosh, it actually works.

00:16:00.459 --> 00:16:02.594
He built a freaking boat
in the woods.

00:16:02.594 --> 00:16:04.229
All right,
now that I'm aware of that,

00:16:04.663 --> 00:16:06.932
this changes a lot of things.
It's actually insane that

00:16:06.932 --> 00:16:08.233
you two built a boat yesterday

00:16:08.233 --> 00:16:12.705
because I brought the two of you
a boat with a Zaxby's restaurant.

00:16:12.738 --> 00:16:15.207
Oh my gosh. That is so cool, Jimmy.

00:16:15.207 --> 00:16:17.142
Before I present the offer,
I want to make sure you're

00:16:17.142 --> 00:16:18.577
in a really good state of mind.

00:16:18.577 --> 00:16:20.679
This is our brand new MrBeast box

00:16:20.679 --> 00:16:23.615
which are now live at
every single Zaxby's across America.

00:16:24.817 --> 00:16:26.452
Oh, my God,
that is so good.

00:16:26.452 --> 00:16:29.922
The MrBeast box comes with the
best tasting chicken known to man.

00:16:29.922 --> 00:16:32.925
And the cool part is, every single
meal comes with the Feastables bar.

00:16:32.925 --> 00:16:35.427
Our goal with this collab
was to take the world's best chicken

00:16:35.427 --> 00:16:36.962
and pair it
with the world's best chocolate.

00:16:36.962 --> 00:16:37.429
Indeed!

00:16:37.529 --> 00:16:39.465
Zaxby's also has 12 sauces.

00:16:39.465 --> 00:16:42.101
There's like so many flavors
happening in my mouth. What is that?

00:16:42.101 --> 00:16:43.369
- That's really good.
- It's the Zax sauce.

00:16:43.435 --> 00:16:44.603
Look how happy they are.

00:16:44.603 --> 00:16:45.838
If you want to be happy like them,

00:16:45.838 --> 00:16:48.140
just go to Zaxby's
and get the MrBeast box right now.

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:49.875
Now that you guys have gotten your meals,

00:16:50.175 --> 00:16:52.544
your day 50 offer is for 50 grand

00:16:52.578 --> 00:16:53.912
you can have this boat.

00:16:53.912 --> 00:16:56.281
We don't have a motor. We don't have
any way to get this thing around.

00:16:56.281 --> 00:16:58.050
So you just use sticks.

00:16:58.751 --> 00:16:59.685
Oh, Lord, I don't know.

00:16:59.685 --> 00:17:02.121
Since you weirdly built the boat
the day before,

00:17:02.121 --> 00:17:04.390
I'll give you a discount.
We'll make it $40,000.

00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:06.959
My answer is I love the ship I made.

00:17:06.959 --> 00:17:08.327
I trust it with my life.

00:17:08.327 --> 00:17:09.661
So I'm going to leave it up to Grizz.

00:17:09.762 --> 00:17:11.330
For $40,000,

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:13.165
- I'm going to pass on the boat.
- Yes!

00:17:13.165 --> 00:17:14.933
I'll get in Hase's death
trap instead.

00:17:14.933 --> 00:17:17.569
If that sinks
and you have to quit, I tried.

00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:19.571
We appreciate the food. That was lovely.

00:17:19.671 --> 00:17:21.173
- Bye, Jimmy.
- I'll see you next time.

00:17:21.173 --> 00:17:24.343
So this ship saved us $40,000.

00:17:24.343 --> 00:17:26.211
- It's still a death trap.
- Hey hey, hey.

00:17:26.578 --> 00:17:29.081
Man, when we first started this
thing, it was in the dead of winter.

00:17:29.081 --> 00:17:30.549
- You remember how cold it was?
- Yeah.

00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:32.217
Now everything is so nice and warm.

00:17:32.217 --> 00:17:34.453
And spring was now in full bloom.

00:17:34.453 --> 00:17:36.388
And they were looking
pretty comfortable.

00:17:36.388 --> 00:17:37.790
There's a lot of flowers here.

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:40.259
- I can't say that I mind it.
- What is today? 51?

00:17:40.259 --> 00:17:40.926
I don't know.

00:17:40.926 --> 00:17:42.127
I lost track.

00:17:42.127 --> 00:17:44.496
- I hear an airplane coming in.
- Where?

00:17:44.496 --> 00:17:45.497
Oh, he's coming straight at us.

00:17:45.497 --> 00:17:48.834
This briefcase puts us at $440,000.

00:17:49.001 --> 00:17:51.470
Time to build the Hase and Grizz loveseat.

00:17:51.537 --> 00:17:54.973
80% of what we're sitting on here
is going straight to my business.

00:17:54.973 --> 00:17:55.674
This case?

00:17:55.674 --> 00:17:57.776
I don't want Katie
to work 24-hour shifts anymore.

00:17:57.776 --> 00:18:00.345
This money is going to do
so much for her and our family.

00:18:00.345 --> 00:18:02.214
But while the warmer weather was nice,

00:18:02.214 --> 00:18:04.583
it presented new problems like snakes....

00:18:04.583 --> 00:18:05.818
Don't want to get bit by that.

00:18:06.418 --> 00:18:07.386
And rats.

00:18:07.519 --> 00:18:09.354
- Get out of here!
- Every night.

00:18:09.421 --> 00:18:10.155
Oh my God.

00:18:10.155 --> 00:18:13.325
And It wasn't long until the lack
of sleep started to make them irritable.

00:18:14.293 --> 00:18:16.395
Looks like Hase
is struggling to get over here.

00:18:16.395 --> 00:18:17.863
Hase, do you need my help?

00:18:17.863 --> 00:18:19.331
What does it look like?

00:18:19.331 --> 00:18:20.999
You want to paddle up-river into the wind?

00:18:20.999 --> 00:18:23.035
Hase, why don't you get over there
and get those fishing lines fixed?

00:18:23.035 --> 00:18:23.435
You know what?

00:18:23.435 --> 00:18:25.370
You shut your mouth
when you're talking to me.

00:18:25.437 --> 00:18:26.438
He's angry.

00:18:26.905 --> 00:18:28.841
Can you check those lines
while you're over there?

00:18:28.841 --> 00:18:31.143
- What do you think I'm doing?
- I don't know, I was just asking.

00:18:31.643 --> 00:18:33.245
Thank you for telling me what to do

00:18:33.245 --> 00:18:35.314
what I'm already doing once again.

00:18:35.981 --> 00:18:36.715
Very angry.

00:18:36.715 --> 00:18:38.117
Keep in mind, at this point,

00:18:38.117 --> 00:18:40.219
Hase and Grizz
 were very close friends,

00:18:40.219 --> 00:18:42.354
but Hase had reached
the end of his rope

00:18:42.354 --> 00:18:44.923
and the jokes just weren't
hitting the same anymore.

00:18:45.858 --> 00:18:48.527
Grizz's idea about how this
would unwind is not working.

00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:51.563
Obviously,
because it's a stupid idea.

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:53.699
Hey. I'm sorry, buddy,
I did not know

00:18:53.699 --> 00:18:55.200
I was actually pissing you off.

00:18:55.634 --> 00:18:58.103
I thought- I did not know
that you were actually upset.

00:18:58.770 --> 00:18:59.304
It's all right.

00:19:01.173 --> 00:19:01.573
Okay.

00:19:02.274 --> 00:19:04.109
And so, feeling frustrated,

00:19:04.143 --> 00:19:07.012
Hase, having turned off his camera,
paddle down river

00:19:07.012 --> 00:19:09.314
where he set up his camp
until the next day.

00:19:09.314 --> 00:19:11.783
Hase has set sail,

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:13.285
and I think he may have run away.

00:19:13.318 --> 00:19:14.319
I certainly be thinking about him.

00:19:14.319 --> 00:19:16.054
I know it's supposed to be cold
at night.

00:19:16.054 --> 00:19:18.323
If he's not back in a couple days,
I'm going to have to go looking for him.

00:19:18.323 --> 00:19:19.558
Let's do something to cheer him up.

00:19:19.558 --> 00:19:21.393
So we got a huge board
over here that was left

00:19:21.393 --> 00:19:23.028
by Jimmy at the last Beast Drop

00:19:23.028 --> 00:19:26.298
And I'm going to repurpose it
into a table with some of our cases.

00:19:26.331 --> 00:19:28.934
This is actually pretty sturdy.

00:19:28.934 --> 00:19:31.703
And when Hase returned home,
he was not empty handed.

00:19:31.703 --> 00:19:34.006
Sounds like Hase has returned
from his great adventure.

00:19:34.373 --> 00:19:37.643
Nice. Oh, there's a sea trout.

00:19:37.676 --> 00:19:38.644
I'm pretty wiped out.

00:19:38.644 --> 00:19:41.480
- Mind if I take a minute.
- No, man. Do your thing.

00:19:43.782 --> 00:19:44.716
Grizz!

00:19:44.716 --> 00:19:46.285
- Yeah, buddy?
- What's this?

00:19:46.285 --> 00:19:46.952
It's our table.

00:19:47.219 --> 00:19:48.787
- We have a table.
- Yeah.

00:19:49.288 --> 00:19:50.956
Oh, man!

00:19:50.956 --> 00:19:52.691
Yeah, I figured
that would perk him up a little bit.

00:19:52.858 --> 00:19:55.928
This is $100,000 table, Grizz.

00:19:57.095 --> 00:19:59.464
- Welcome back, buddy.
- Feels good to be home.

00:19:59.498 --> 00:20:00.165
Come on.

00:20:00.599 --> 00:20:03.402
With their survival needs met
and their friendship restored,

00:20:03.402 --> 00:20:05.204
one question still remained.

00:20:05.204 --> 00:20:06.638
How long will they stay?

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:09.408
We gotta have a serious
conversation.

00:20:09.408 --> 00:20:10.842
- Yeah.
- The end.

00:20:11.476 --> 00:20:13.545
Honestly, I'd have been done
five days ago.

00:20:14.012 --> 00:20:15.480
Maybe push, like, an extra week.

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:18.283
I mean, hell, that's a $35,000 each.

00:20:18.283 --> 00:20:20.652
If I pulled that flare on day 70,

00:20:20.652 --> 00:20:21.520
how would you feel?

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:22.588
I would feel...

00:20:24.356 --> 00:20:26.425
really let down and lied to.

00:20:26.858 --> 00:20:28.560
I propose at day 70

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:31.630
we have a conversation decide
if we're going to push further.

00:20:31.663 --> 00:20:32.197
That's fair.

00:20:33.365 --> 00:20:36.969
I promised Grizz
that I would stay longer for him,

00:20:37.369 --> 00:20:38.670
but I'm not happy about it.

00:20:40.372 --> 00:20:41.073
Morning, guys.

00:20:41.073 --> 00:20:44.409
So Hase has been a little upset.

00:20:44.509 --> 00:20:46.545
I'm seeing it. He's keeping to himself,

00:20:46.545 --> 00:20:48.146
you know?
So I'm a little worried about him.

00:20:48.146 --> 00:20:50.415
Spoken to Grizz about it.
He wants me to stay longer.

00:20:50.415 --> 00:20:52.918
He's kind of pushing me to stay longer
and stay longer.

00:20:52.918 --> 00:20:56.388
At some point I got to stop being
wilderness guy and go be dad.

00:20:56.388 --> 00:20:57.055
Another day.

00:20:59.391 --> 00:20:59.825
Yeah.

00:21:01.159 --> 00:21:02.527
Oh, no. No, no.

00:21:02.527 --> 00:21:04.196
I knew that was going to happen.
I saw it. Oh no.

00:21:04.196 --> 00:21:05.330
Oh, no.

00:21:06.298 --> 00:21:10.102
Hase going to check out to the case
that has dropped from the sky.

00:21:10.435 --> 00:21:13.639
Day 70. I'm going to see
if Grizz is good being done today.

00:21:13.639 --> 00:21:14.439
See what he says.

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.808
What are we going to do
with all this money?

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:20.712
I kind of want to talk to you
about that.

00:21:20.712 --> 00:21:22.681
I´m kind of ready to hit the flare.

00:21:24.149 --> 00:21:25.050
What do you think about that?

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:26.184
I want to stay longer.

00:21:26.184 --> 00:21:27.919
I know that that you've got to pull...

00:21:29.421 --> 00:21:30.722
away from this thing with family.

00:21:30.722 --> 00:21:31.923
I know, I know, I know, I know,

00:21:31.923 --> 00:21:33.292
we've talked about it a thousand times.

00:21:33.292 --> 00:21:35.360
I just want to know
how you feel about it today.

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:35.994
Yes or no?

00:21:37.329 --> 00:21:38.630
Can you go one more day?

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:42.234
Give yourself 24 hours
just to kind of feel it out.

00:21:42.234 --> 00:21:43.268
I thought a lot about it,

00:21:43.735 --> 00:21:45.804
but if you want to go another day,
let's go another day.

00:21:50.275 --> 00:21:51.343
How's it going, boys?

00:21:51.343 --> 00:21:52.244
- How are you, buddy?
- Good.

00:21:52.311 --> 00:21:53.845
Let's go on a little walkie-walk.

00:21:53.845 --> 00:21:54.680
We can go over here.

00:21:55.213 --> 00:21:56.682
Let's say Hase isn't
a part of the equation.

00:21:56.682 --> 00:21:57.215
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:21:57.215 --> 00:21:59.284
How many more days do you think
you could survive out here?

00:21:59.284 --> 00:22:01.486
Let's call it 45 days

00:22:01.486 --> 00:22:03.255
would probably be as far as I'd go.

00:22:03.255 --> 00:22:05.090
How many do you think
he has left in the tank?

00:22:06.058 --> 00:22:07.693
He talks about it every day.

00:22:07.693 --> 00:22:10.028
How often do you think about
shooting the flare?

00:22:10.028 --> 00:22:10.462
Every day.

00:22:10.462 --> 00:22:11.330
What stops you?

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:13.565
At this stage, Grizz.

00:22:13.565 --> 00:22:15.367
You know?
He wants to make a million dollars

00:22:15.367 --> 00:22:16.668
and it's hard to say no to that.

00:22:16.668 --> 00:22:18.403
I have an obligation
to him, too.

00:22:18.403 --> 00:22:21.573
But it's starting to go towards
family.

00:22:21.673 --> 00:22:22.374
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:22:22.374 --> 00:22:24.643
When you do shoot that flare,
that's going to be crazy.

00:22:24.643 --> 00:22:25.544
Oh, I can't wait.

00:22:27.879 --> 00:22:28.914
Sleep okay last night?

00:22:32.551 --> 00:22:34.052
I don't want to disappoint Grizz but...

00:22:35.854 --> 00:22:36.688
I'm...

00:22:37.522 --> 00:22:38.190
I think I'm done.

00:22:39.524 --> 00:22:43.261
Thought it would be cool
to come back here to our first camp,

00:22:43.328 --> 00:22:46.431
where I was shoulder to shoulder
with Grizz every single night.

00:22:47.132 --> 00:22:48.667
And after that it was like:
"All right, dude,

00:22:49.935 --> 00:22:50.769
we're brothers now."

00:22:51.236 --> 00:22:52.771
I expected to walk away
with a lot of money.

00:22:52.771 --> 00:22:55.874
I didn't expect to walk away
with, like, a friend for life and...

00:22:56.575 --> 00:22:57.709
that's so meaningful to me.

00:22:59.111 --> 00:23:00.312
I kind of got to think about

00:23:00.312 --> 00:23:02.647
what's right for me and my family.

00:23:05.817 --> 00:23:06.551
It's...

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:10.756
Hase got so desperate
that he literally went

00:23:10.756 --> 00:23:12.958
into Grizzlies bag
and stole the flare gun,

00:23:12.958 --> 00:23:16.061
even though it was his idea
to separate it into two parts.

00:23:16.895 --> 00:23:19.197
At this point, all I have to do

00:23:20.799 --> 00:23:21.800
is shoot this thing.

00:23:23.869 --> 00:23:25.337
And I get to be a dad again.
You know?

00:23:28.807 --> 00:23:30.842
I know this thing is
is very challenging.

00:23:31.243 --> 00:23:32.577
What we're doing out
here is not easy.

00:23:32.944 --> 00:23:34.813
I really, truly do
believe that you're doing

00:23:34.813 --> 00:23:36.615
- what's right for your family.
- I disagree.

00:23:36.615 --> 00:23:39.284
You're providing for them in a way
that's gonna change their life.

00:23:39.284 --> 00:23:41.453
Now it's gone the other way.

00:23:41.453 --> 00:23:42.187
Now it's...

00:23:43.088 --> 00:23:43.822
I think I need...

00:23:44.423 --> 00:23:45.390
I need to be there.

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:46.625
I think that you've been really upset

00:23:47.292 --> 00:23:49.528
and you've been missing
your family really bad.

00:23:49.528 --> 00:23:50.362
I feel like...

00:23:51.563 --> 00:23:53.398
- I think the money doesn't matter.
- You spiraled through this thing.

00:23:53.398 --> 00:23:55.300
The money doesn't...
The money doesn't matter to me anymore.

00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:58.303
And really, the only thing that's
keeping me here is you.

00:23:58.503 --> 00:23:59.905
And I'm sick of it.

00:24:00.906 --> 00:24:03.708
Yeah, my family needs me, too, you know?

00:24:03.809 --> 00:24:06.378
You're very good at,
you know, manipulating me.

00:24:11.116 --> 00:24:12.717
I don’t know.

00:24:13.585 --> 00:24:17.255
It was clear that in this moment Grizz
was going to have to make a decision.

00:24:17.489 --> 00:24:19.024
Convince Hase
to continue

00:24:19.024 --> 00:24:22.027
surviving in these woods
for more and more money,

00:24:22.828 --> 00:24:26.498
or be there for his friend
when he needed him the most.

00:24:28.733 --> 00:24:29.935
I can't imagine...

00:24:30.569 --> 00:24:34.473
having gone through this experience
with anyone else.

00:24:34.773 --> 00:24:35.907
I mean, I really do, like,

00:24:36.908 --> 00:24:38.910
I genuinely
think of you like a brother,

00:24:39.778 --> 00:24:40.212
you know?

00:24:41.213 --> 00:24:45.050
I'm sorry that I've just pushed you
on and on and on.

00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:47.385
- I just don't want to let you down.
- You're not letting me down.

00:24:47.519 --> 00:24:49.688
- Yeah, I am.
- Brothers don't let each other down.

00:24:50.689 --> 00:24:51.690
That's the way it is.

00:24:52.224 --> 00:24:52.958
Everything.

00:24:54.092 --> 00:24:56.027
Everything's got to come to an end
sometime.

00:24:56.294 --> 00:24:57.696
Let me see that flare.

00:24:59.564 --> 00:25:00.832
I owe you this.

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:04.503
And to be honest with you,

00:25:04.503 --> 00:25:06.104
I'm sorry that it's taken so long.

00:25:08.173 --> 00:25:09.841
I think it's time for us
to do this thing, buddy.

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:17.148
- I love you, buddy.
- I love you too, man.

00:25:22.521 --> 00:25:23.522
You smell bad.

00:25:23.922 --> 00:25:26.124
I think that they shot the flare.
No, you take that one.

00:25:26.124 --> 00:25:27.259
Let's go check in on them.

00:25:27.459 --> 00:25:28.760
- We're rich!
- We're rich!

00:25:29.928 --> 00:25:31.296
- Boys. Oh my God.
- Hey, Jimmy.

00:25:31.296 --> 00:25:32.764
When we dropped them off

00:25:32.764 --> 00:25:34.232
this is what they looked like,

00:25:34.666 --> 00:25:37.068
and here's them 74 days later.

00:25:37.502 --> 00:25:38.303
Crazy.

00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:40.171
Yes, they look crazy.

00:25:41.339 --> 00:25:44.676
You haven't left these woods
in 74 days.

00:25:44.676 --> 00:25:47.779
- Dude, I'm so ready.
- One final surprise.

00:25:47.779 --> 00:25:49.214
Oh my God!

00:25:49.214 --> 00:25:51.750
Oh my gosh! Hi, Talia, baby!

00:25:52.117 --> 00:25:53.184
I love you!

00:25:56.421 --> 00:26:00.759
After 74 days, they won $670,000.

00:26:00.759 --> 00:26:01.526
In case you forgot,

00:26:01.526 --> 00:26:03.562
