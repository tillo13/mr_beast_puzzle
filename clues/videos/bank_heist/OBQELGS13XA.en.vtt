00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:05.589
I'd like to withdraw $1 million.

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:11.720
Well, where's your security?

00:00:13.096 --> 00:00:14.014
[clicks tongue] Uh…

00:00:16.058 --> 00:00:17.768
[nervous laugh] Uh--

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:19.520
Yo, we need to go.
What's taking so long?

00:00:19.603 --> 00:00:21.104
Nolan, I'm busy right now. Ok?

00:00:21.188 --> 00:00:22.314
Can you just give me some time?

00:00:28.278 --> 00:00:29.279
I need the money.

00:00:31.615 --> 00:00:32.824
-Name?
-Jimmy.

00:00:32.908 --> 00:00:34.368
What do you want the money for, Johnny?

00:00:34.451 --> 00:00:36.119
Jimmy, and I really can't tell you.

00:00:36.203 --> 00:00:37.496
Ok, what's your job?

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:38.747
I make YouTube videos.

00:00:39.331 --> 00:00:40.666
[chuckles]

00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:42.960
What is your job?

00:00:43.043 --> 00:00:44.002
[chuckles]

00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:46.296
Yo! Our tanks are getting towed.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.009
The sign says 30 minute parking.

00:00:53.136 --> 00:00:54.888
Just go figure it out.
Go figure it out.

00:00:54.972 --> 00:00:57.391
What on Earth are you going to do
with $1 million?

00:00:57.474 --> 00:00:59.268
It's a secret.
I really can't tell you.

00:00:59.351 --> 00:01:02.437
You gotta tell me,
or we have no more to discuss.

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:05.524
Uh, can you guys give us a minute?

00:01:06.567 --> 00:01:08.277
You guys as well, can you all just…

00:01:08.777 --> 00:01:09.570
Yeah.

00:01:11.196 --> 00:01:13.282
Yeah, and you should go with them
if you're not gonna tell me--

00:01:13.365 --> 00:01:14.032
Listen here, granny.

00:01:14.116 --> 00:01:16.076
I'm doing a super secret
Super Bowl commercial

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:17.244
where I'm giving away $1 million

00:01:17.327 --> 00:01:18.954
and we’re hiding it
in a base in the desert.

00:01:19.037 --> 00:01:21.707
And the last thing I need
is this million dollars.

00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:23.917
Desert? I thought it would be cooler.

00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:24.793
Cooler?

00:01:25.544 --> 00:01:28.255
It's a vault with $1 million,
with a giant base,

00:01:28.338 --> 00:01:30.257
hundreds of guards,
thousands of lasers.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.383
How is that not cool?

00:01:31.633 --> 00:01:33.302
Hey, Jim.
We really need to speed this up.

00:01:33.385 --> 00:01:34.511
I've got Salesforce on the line.

00:01:34.595 --> 00:01:35.637
Oh!

00:01:35.721 --> 00:01:37.890
-Are you ok?
-I love Salesforce.

00:01:37.973 --> 00:01:40.809
-Me and Marc need the million dollars.
-Ah! Oh, Johnny.

00:01:40.893 --> 00:01:42.186
You know Marc Benioff?

00:01:42.269 --> 00:01:43.187
I know him, yeah…

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.521
Mr. Marc Benioff?

00:01:44.605 --> 00:01:46.440
Yeah, and he would love it
if you gave us the money.

00:01:46.523 --> 00:01:47.858
That million dollars? Yeah.

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:48.901
Oh yes, absolutely.

00:01:48.984 --> 00:01:50.152
[Jimmy] Yup, you got it.
Right there.

00:01:50.903 --> 00:01:55.365
Send over a million dollars
immediately for Johnny. Yes.

00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:58.619
Uh, it's right there.
The million dollars is right there.

00:02:03.707 --> 00:02:06.335
My favorite Salesforce tool is Slack.

00:02:06.418 --> 00:02:08.504
-[Jimmy stuttering]
-My bank uses it all the time!

00:02:08.587 --> 00:02:09.713
I love to hear that.

00:02:09.796 --> 00:02:10.380
Yeah.

00:02:10.464 --> 00:02:12.758
By the way, during the fourth quarter
of the game this Sunday

00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:14.051
is when our commercial will air.

00:02:14.134 --> 00:02:14.927
You gonna watch it?

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.845
Oh, oh, I would never miss it.

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:18.347
Ok, you might win $1 million!

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.598
Bye, Johnny!

00:02:21.725 --> 00:02:22.684
Are you kidding me?

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:24.645
Jimmy's never gonna believe this.
