Some of these puzzles use codes you can find online.

With the Super Bowl ad, almost everything Jimmy passes by is a clue. Look up, down, forward, backward, and behind the scenes. Figure out how to get an answer from each weird thing.

In the bank, the same is true, but you will need specific content from the Super Bowl ad to solve anything there.

Last, but not least, if you found the video playlist's pinned comments, each puzzle ends in a word that makes part of a 9-word clue, in order.

The word lengths are 5, 9, 5, 7, 8, 4, 9, 6, and 5.

That will help define the nature of the search.

If you can get that 9-word clue, you'll take the first step on your journey.

There is a direct way through this ultra-hard puzzle hunt.

You can find it.

Then you can win a million dollars!
