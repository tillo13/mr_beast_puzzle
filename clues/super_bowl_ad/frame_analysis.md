## FRAME-BY-FRAME BREAKDOWN

### ACT 1: VAULT OPENING (Frames 1-8, 0.0s-3.5s)

**Frame 1 (0.0s):** Close-up of a glass case/vault filled with dollar bills. Several bills are highlighted with RED/PINK borders -- approximately 10-12 bills stand out from the rest. These red-bordered bills may encode a pattern or count. The bills appear to be US currency (ones, possibly hundreds).

**Frame 2 (0.5s):** MrBeast enters frame from left, blurry/in motion, walking in front of the money vault. Same red-bordered bills visible. He is wearing all black (suit/jacket).

| **Guard patches / badges** | On soldiers' armor | 37-44 | Shield-shaped patches on soldiers' chest armor |

## DECODED ITEMS (confirmed)

### 1. QR CODE — DECODED
- **Frames**: 57-64 (aerial view of military compound)
- **Decoded from**: `qr_hires/qr_0063.jpg` using OpenCV QRCodeDetector
- **URL**: `https://sforce.co/4bAAGMH?r=qr`
- **Redirects to**: `https://mrbeast.salesforce.com/bts` (301 redirect)
- **Status**: The /bts page returns **403 Forbidden** — likely requires registration/login or browser access
- **Significance**: "bts" = "behind the scenes" — may contain additional puzzle content or extraction instructions

### 2. SLACK EMOJI REACTIONS — IDENTIFIED
- **Frames**: 27-29 (below "Slackbot: Good luck!" message)
- **5 emojis confirmed** (left to right):
  1. **Camel** 🐪 — possibly maps to Pyramids puzzle (P8, Egypt theme)
  2. **Dinosaur** 🦕 (sauropod/brontosaurus) — possibly maps to Pokemon Go (P5)
  3. **Gold coin** 🪙 — possibly maps to Circle puzzle (P9, "anything in circle")
  4. **Anchor** ⚓ — mapping unclear (Wells/Africa P1? Beach P3?)
  5. **Tent with trees** ⛺ — directly maps to **Wilderness/Tents puzzle (P6)**
- **Theory**: These 5 emojis may represent 5 of the 9 puzzles, or hint at answer words/themes

### 3. CONTROL ROOM MONITORS — CATALOGUED
- **Frames**: 14-26 (best views: 18, 20, 24)
- **9 distinct symbols on monitors** — likely one per puzzle video:

| # | Symbol | Best frame | Monitor location | Possible puzzle match |
|---|--------|-----------|------------------|----------------------|
| 1 | Spider | 17-18 | Upper-left bank | ? |
| 2 | Bird (white songbird) | 14-18 | Center-left | ? |
| 3 | Sine wave (blue) | 14-18 | Left bank, below bird | ? |
| 4 | Ear / hearing icon | 14-24 | Upper-right (prominent) | ? |
| 5 | Elephant (gray) | 19-24 | Far-right | Wells/Africa (P1)? |
| 6 | 10^5 (100,000) | 20-26 | Upper-right monitor | ? |
| 7 | Faces grid (headshots) | 15-24 | Right bank | Adopted Dogs (P7)? or 600 Strangers (P2)? |
| 8 | Smoking device/object | 19-24 | Far-right lower | Wilderness (P6)? |
| 9 | Swiss/medical cross | 24 | Small monitor, far right | ? |

- **Additional non-puzzle monitors**: MrBeast headshot with "I D" colored bars, Salesforce cloud logos, sticky notes/bulletin board
- **Symbol-to-puzzle mapping NOT confirmed** — needs further analysis

## PARTIALLY DECODED / IN PROGRESS

### 4. VAULT RIM NUMBERS — PARTIALLY READ
- **Frames**: 51-53 (best), also vault_hires/ at 24fps (frames 38-45 best)
- **Enhanced crops saved**: `vault_hires/rim_top_2x.jpg`, `enhanced_top_vault_0040.jpg`
- **Video source**: 1080p at 24fps — this is the max resolution available from YouTube
- **What we can read** (partial, reading clockwise from upper-left):
  - Upper-left arc: `...1-1-8-4-3-1-1-5-1-5-1-4...`
  - Top-center: `...0-1-1-1-0-4+...`
  - Upper-right continuing: `...1-1-9-0-4-1-0-4-2...`
  - Left arc: `...1-1-8-4-3-1-1-...`
- **Separator pattern**: Single digits separated by `-` (dash), with occasional `+` signs
- **Theory**: The `+` signs may separate 9 segments (one per puzzle). Each segment contains extraction coordinates or indices.
- **STATUS: NEEDS HIGHER RESOLUTION** — the 1080p video is insufficient to read all digits confidently. MrBeast's GMA hint ("look for numbers in photos I took at the Super Bowl") suggests **still photos** may show the vault door more clearly.

### 5. BRAILLE DOTS ON BLAST DOOR — NOT DECODED
- **Frames**: 30-36 (best: 30-31), also braille_hires/ at 24fps
- **Two groups** of raised rivets/dots on upper portion of blast door
- Left group: ~4-5 Braille characters wide
- Right group: ~4-5 Braille characters wide
- **STATUS**: Dot positions not mapped. Need higher resolution or photo closeup.

### 6. MATHEMATICAL FORMULA
- **n^3 = m^2** (or possibly n^3 = n^2) — large screen, bottom-right of control room
- **Frames**: 24-26
- **If n^3 = m^2**: Notable solutions include n=4/m=8, n=9/m=27 (perfect powers)
- **If n^3 = n^2**: Simplifies to n=1 (trivial) or n=0
- **Significance**: Unknown — may relate to a specific puzzle's extraction

---

## STILL UNRESOLVED

### 7. BEAM NUMBER "3634026-1" (frames 33-38)
- Stamped on metal crossbar/barrier beam with gear symbol
- Possibly reads "3634B26-1" — industrial part number format
- Could be a coordinate, reference number, or red herring

### 8. ELECTRICAL PANEL LIGHTS (frames 36-44)
- 2x4 grid of colored lights: amber, green, red
- Pattern may encode binary data or serve as a key
- Needs closer analysis of light on/off states across frames

### 9. RED-BORDERED DOLLAR BILLS (frames 1-2)
- ~10-12 bills highlighted with red/pink borders in vault opening scene
- Count or arrangement may be meaningful
- Could relate to "CASH TENT" community-decoded clue

### 10. LASER BEAM PATTERN (frames 9-13)
- 8-10 red beams creating complex web in corridor
- Could form letters/numbers when intersections are mapped
- Low priority — likely atmospheric

## KEY NEXT STEPS

1. **FIND MRBEAST'S SUPER BOWL PHOTOS** — GMA hint says "look for numbers in photos I took at the Super Bowl." Photos likely on Instagram (@mrbeast) and X (@MrBeast) from Feb 8-9. Known post: photo with Rosé captioned "I like football." These photos may show vault rim numbers clearly, or contain other hidden numbers. **No one in the community has publicly decoded these yet.**

2. **ACCESS mrbeast.salesforce.com/bts** — The QR code destination. Returns 403 via curl/fetch. Try with browser login.

3. **MAP SYMBOLS TO PUZZLES** — Match the 9 control room monitor symbols to the 9 puzzle videos. This mapping is needed to know which extraction key applies to which puzzle.

4. **DECODE BRAILLE** — Map the dot patterns on the blast door. May need community photos or higher-res screenshots.

5. **READ FULL VAULT RIM** — Either from MrBeast's photos (see #1) or from a 4K source of the ad if one exists.
