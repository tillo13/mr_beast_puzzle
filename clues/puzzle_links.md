## Observations

- **Common username:** The account "BeastForce67" or "beastforce67" appears on Reddit, ImageShack, Pixelfed, imgpile, 500px, and Medium. This is clearly a puzzle-specific account created for the hunt.
- **Platform diversity:** Puzzles are distributed across 9 different platforms (Pinterest, Reddit, Imgur, ImageShack, Photobucket, Medium, Pixelfed, imgpile, 500px). This aligns with the puzzle design philosophy of "nonlinear, interconnected" puzzles scattered across the web.
- **Image-heavy platforms:** Most platforms are image hosting services, suggesting the puzzles are visual in nature (images containing hidden clues, steganography, visual puzzles, etc.).
- **Comment tone:** Each pinned comment follows a pattern of referencing the video content, then redirecting to the puzzle with a casual transition.
- **Video 2 exception:** The only video where the pinned comment is by @BeastPhilanthropy rather than @MrBeast (this is the Beast Philanthropy channel's video).
