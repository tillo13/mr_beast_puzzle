# Contributing

This repo is an experiment in running a collaborative project entirely through GitHub's toolchain. The MrBeast puzzle gives it a real purpose — but contributions on either front (GitHub workflow improvements or puzzle progress) are equally welcome.

The puzzle community is fragmented across Reddit, Discord, YouTube comments, Twitter/X, and more. This repo exists to centralize findings in one structured, searchable, version-controlled place — instead of scattered across platform silos where things get lost.

## The Puzzle (Quick Context)

1. **9 YouTube videos** each have a pinned comment linking to a sub-puzzle on a different platform
2. Each solved puzzle yields **one word**
3. The 9 words form a **meta-clue** (word lengths: 5, 9, 5, 7, 8, 4, 9, 6, 5)
4. The meta-clue is an instruction that leads to a hidden code
5. Slack the code to MrBeast to win

The Super Bowl ad contains extraction keys needed to pull answer words from solved puzzles — they're all interconnected.

## Where to Put Things

| What you have | Where it goes |
|---------------|---------------|
| Puzzle solution or analysis | `puzzles/XX_name/notes.md` |
| Frame screenshots or images | `clues/super_bowl_ad/` or `clues/teaser_videos/` |
| Community intel or web findings | `sources/<topic>/` |
| Scripts or tools | `scripts/` |
| Documentation | `docs/` |

## Ground Rules

- **Document everything** — screenshots, links, reasoning
- **Label theories vs confirmed findings**
- **Don't delete others' work** — add counter-analysis alongside if you disagree
- **Don't post the final answer publicly** if you find it
- **Note if you used AI** in your PR/issue so others can evaluate the methodology

## Puzzle Platforms

Each sub-puzzle is posted by **BeastForce67** on a different platform:
