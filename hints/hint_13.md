## Preamble

> EVERYTHING'S OUT
> We said this hunt could be solved on day one, and that's true.
> But it would have been a lot harder then.
> All the clues we've provided have given you a much fuller picture of the world.
> Now you have the opportunity to chart a path to the million.

## Hint #13 Text

> We've seen quite a few solutions to every puzzle in the hunt.
> Except one.
> A computer screen gave you a lot of the same type of logic puzzle.
> Like, a whole bunch.
> But those of you solving alone have been limited in your ability to see more than one.
> No more.
> Check your Puzzle Card for this puzzle.
> It'll give you quite the assortment of options.

## Analysis

### Key Takeaways

1. **"Every puzzle solved except one"** — the Sudoku/onemil.xyz puzzle is the LAST UNSOLVED puzzle
2. **"A computer screen gave you a lot of the same type of logic puzzle"** = Screen 10^5 → onemil.xyz → Sudoku
3. **"Like, a whole bunch"** = a million Sudoku
4. **"Limited to seeing more than one"** = each person only got one Sudoku via fingerprinting
5. **"Check your Puzzle Card"** = asking Slackbot about Sudoku on a Puzzle Card now gives access to MORE Sudoku (not just the one you were assigned)
6. **"Quite the assortment of options"** = multiple Sudoku available through Puzzle Cards

### Action Required

- Ask Beastbot about Sudoku on a Puzzle Card — should now give access to multiple Sudoku
- The 25 carefully-designed Sudoku (from Hint #15) may be accessible this way
