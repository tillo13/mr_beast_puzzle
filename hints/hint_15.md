## Preamble

> TAKE YOUR BEST SHOT
> No one has submitted a winning entry yet.
> You can still win a million dollars.
> But you should take your best shot.
> We see a lot of people circling around the correct answers.
> Nobody with the complete picture.
> But maybe soon.

## Hint #15 Text

> There are two major things that we don't think anyone has solved.
> One is the big thing to do with all the location names.
> We'll have more to say about that later.
>
> The other is the puzzle with a million Sudoku.
> That produces a stage one answer.
>
> There are 25 carefully-designed Sudoku numbered 000001 to 000025.
> Each has a different encryption based on what its numbers do.
> For each, you need to solve some Sudoku in that puzzle's sequence. When you solve them as a Sudoku solver, you'll see a pattern about that puzzle which helps crack that part of the code.
> Find each one, then think of what to do with what's isolated in each of the original puzzles.
> But that's not the only interesting thing about the original puzzles.
> You need the total of every isolated detail in each of them to crack this.
> A few more trusted Sudoku are at the place mentioned on your Puzzle Card.
> Check them out. And then enjoy solving them.

## Analysis

### Two Major Unsolved Things (OFFICIAL)

1. **"The big thing to do with all the location names"** — the 91 locations need some overall transformation/assembly. Nobody has this. "We'll have more to say about that later" = more hints coming.

2. **The million Sudoku puzzle** — produces a STAGE ONE answer (i.e., a location name)

### Sudoku Puzzle Mechanics (OFFICIAL — most detailed description yet)

1. **25 carefully-designed Sudoku** numbered 000001 to 000025
   - These are special puzzle numbers on onemil.xyz
   - Each has a DIFFERENT encryption/pattern

2. **"Each has a different encryption based on what its numbers do"**
   - The digits in each solved Sudoku DO something (encode, map, transform)
   - Each of the 25 has a DIFFERENT rule

3. **"Solve some Sudoku in that puzzle's sequence"**
   - Each of the 25 generates a SEQUENCE of related Sudoku
   - You need to solve MULTIPLE Sudoku from each sequence
   - When solved, you'll "see a pattern" about that puzzle

4. **"What's isolated in each of the original puzzles"**
   - The 25 original Sudoku each have something "isolated" — a digit, cell, or pattern that stands out
   - "Find each one" = identify the isolated element in each

5. **"You need the total of every isolated detail"**
   - SUM all the isolated elements across all 25 Sudoku
   - This total is needed to "crack this"

6. **"A few more trusted Sudoku are at the place mentioned on your Puzzle Card"**
   - Asking Slackbot about Sudoku on a Puzzle Card gives a URL/location with additional Sudoku
   - These are "trusted" = designed, not random

### Key Questions

- What are Sudoku #000001 through #000025 on onemil.xyz?
- What pattern/encryption does each use?
- What is "isolated" in each?
- What does the total produce?
- Where is "the place mentioned on your Puzzle Card"?
