# Hint #10 — Feb 18, 2026

**Source:** mrbeast.salesforce.com (OFFICIAL)

## Preamble

> YOU'RE CLOSING IN
> We're looking at the Puzzle Cards and seeing a lot of progress show up in the last day.
> We think nobody's got the complete picture on stage 1, but a bunch of you have a very strong handle on it.
> Many of you are making great strides on stage 2's Beast Travel site.
> So much that you're swiftly meeting the criteria for even more of it.
> But we want to say one thing, because we've seen it a lot.
> No one who says they've won is telling you the truth.

## Hint #10 Text

> There are more things that **aren't** puzzles than there are things that **are** puzzles.
> Either they came up randomly or sent you down paths we never imagined.
> We don't want you to lose focus.
>
> These things are distractions. They are **not** puzzles:
> - Those four clocks.
> - Mike's bat shirt.
> - That tank insignia that looks like a bar code.
> - Random anagrams.
> - Any X or YouTube account that has popped up since this hunt started.
> - The word "hopscotch."
> - Any other Roamy you might ever come across.
> - And, of course, Red Herring Bank. Because, you see, it's a red herring.

## Analysis

### Confirmed Red Herrings (OFFICIAL — stop investigating these)

| Item | Our Status | Impact |
|------|-----------|--------|
| **Four clocks** | We noted BTS wall clocks (Tokyo ~4:25, London ~1:15, Chicago ~3:10, NY ~3:05). Beastbot said it was a puzzle. | **DEBUNKED** — Beastbot was wrong/misleading. London 1:13 clock theory is dead. |
| **Mike's bat shirt** | Never investigated deeply | Confirmed irrelevant |
| **Tank insignia (bar code)** | We analyzed tank barcode in `tank_barcode_analysis.md` | **DEBUNKED** — stop analyzing tank markings |
| **Random anagrams** | We've done extensive anagram analysis (ROAMY→MORAY, subdomain anagrams, etc.) | **DEBUNKED** — stop anagramming random things. Specific puzzle anagrams (like crossword "mix it up") may still be valid. |
| **X/YouTube accounts since hunt started** | Elephant85673 Twitter account was investigated | **DEBUNKED** — all post-launch social accounts are fake/fan-made |
| **"Hopscotch"** | Community was investigating this word | Confirmed irrelevant |
| **"Any other Roamy"** | ROAMY the Globe mascot on beast.travel is legit; any OTHER Roamy appearances are not | Roamy on beast.travel = real. Roamy elsewhere = fake. |
| **Red Herring Bank** | We extensively analyzed the check: MICR numbers, routing numbers, calendar dates, etc. | **DEBUNKED** — the bank name literally says "red herring." MICR numbers, check details, tank barcode = all distractions. |

### Key Takeaways

1. **"Nobody's got the complete picture on stage 1"** — Even top teams are missing pieces. Our ~30 Stage 1 locations (via Team Omega) are incomplete.

2. **"Swiftly meeting the criteria for even more of it"** — Beast Travel is EXPANDING based on puzzle card submissions. More puzzles are being unlocked.

3. **"No one who says they've won is telling you the truth"** — Nobody has won yet (as of Feb 18).

4. **Red Herring Bank is 100% a red herring** — This kills all MICR routing analysis, bank check number theories, calendar date extraction. Significant time savings going forward.

5. **Beastbot can be wrong** — The clocks were Beastbot-confirmed as a puzzle, but Hint #10 officially debunks them. Don't blindly trust Beastbot confirmations.

### Impact on Our Work

- **STOP**: MICR analysis, bank check numbers, tank barcode, clock theories, subdomain anagrams
- **CONTINUE**: Beast Travel combinations, crossword extraction, 9 site/social puzzles (Hint #9), Stage 1 locations
- **NOTE**: "Random anagrams" being debunked does NOT invalidate specific puzzle-directed anagrams (crossword "if mixed up, mix it up" hint)
