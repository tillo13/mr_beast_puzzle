## Preamble

> MORE PUZZLE CARDS
> It did not occur to us that you would want more than 200 Puzzle Cards apiece.
> Some of you blew through that number.
> So now you get 500 Puzzle Cards apiece.
> You're welcome.

## Hint #11 Text

> We see you all are booking trips from our new travel agency, Beast Travel.
> You can take trips by car, by horse, and by plane.
> Those trips by car can be challenging to narrow down.
> You should take them literally.
> When you get a city nickname, you don't need any extra words or inferences.
> Just find a place that uses that **exact** nickname (not the phrase as its name or translation).
> Then you'll get to your destination.
> See you there.

## Analysis

### Key Takeaways

1. **Puzzle card limit raised to 500** per person (was 200). Both our accounts benefit.
2. **Car rebuses = city nicknames, taken LITERALLY**
   - When a rebus decodes to a phrase like "Oil City" or "City of Churches", find a place that uses that EXACT NICKNAME
   - Don't look for translations or interpretations — the nickname IS the answer
   - Example: "Oil City" = Oil City, Pennsylvania (a real place with that exact name)
   - This validates our BARODYNAMICS → "Oil City" → Oil City, PA solve

### Impact on Beast Travel

- EBULLIOSCOPE rebus = churches + city skyline. Need to find a place whose EXACT NICKNAME is whatever the rebus decodes to (e.g., "City of Churches" = Adelaide, Australia? Or Ayacucho?)
- All car puzzles should be re-examined with "exact nickname" rule
