## Preamble: Progress Report

> You guys are making tremendous progress!
>
> We'll summarize what we are seeing so far, though of course a lot of it is happening in places we can't see (aka we have heard of tons of discords and slack groups and group chats). Which is great! Solve publicly or privately, it's up to you!
>
> **Many of you have already figured out - this hunt has 3 main hubs in this first stage (yes there's stages - like rooms in the vault, but more on that another day).**
>
> **Hub 1: Video Playlist** — We've seen tens of thousands of solutions to those puzzles and the overall message there.
>
> **Hub 2: The Commercial (Super Bowl ad)** — We've seen many, many solutions to some of the puzzles there, but a number of the puzzles are eluding folks.
>
> **Hub 3: The Bank** — A lot of people are stuck on the puzzles in that, and for good reason. They're only solvable if you use an element of the other major video.
>
> **There are at least two more stages, and we can't say much about them yet. Maybe tomorrow. Maybe.**

## HINT #2:

> **The video in the bank was released before the Big Game. We didn't want anything solved before that point.**
>
> **So we made the bank video clues extra hard in a very specific way:**
>
> **We tied each screen in the Salesforce computer lab to one clue in the bank video.**
>
> **Which screen goes with which clue ... that's up to you to figure out.**
>
> **Each is used only once, so once you tie a screen to a bank video clue, you won't use it for any other clue.**

> **In one of the Behind the Scenes videos, you might have seen puzzlemaster Mike drop a crossword puzzle. That crossword is here and was a gift to Jimmy. That crossword might also be a key to STAGE 2. Maybe you can find it out there. or maybe you can zoom in.**
>
> **Either way, it doesn't have any clues ... yet.**
>
> **The more progress you make, the more the clues will fill in. You'll need those for the endgame.**

## Key Takeaways

1. **13 monitor symbols in Super Bowl ad → 13 bank video clues** (one-to-one mapping)
2. Each monitor is used **exactly once** (no reuse)
3. **Crossword is dormant** — clues populate as Stage 1 progresses
4. **Crossword is required for endgame** (Stage 2 key)
5. **Multiple stages confirmed** ("at least two more stages")
6. Mike Selinker shows the crossword in a BTS video ("zoom in" to see it)
