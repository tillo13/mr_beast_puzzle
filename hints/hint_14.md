**Source:** mrbeast.salesforce.com (OFFICIAL)

## Preamble

> WE SEE YOU GETTING CLOSE
> We're seeing interesting behavior in public forums.
> People getting into small groups, sharing answers by DM, theorizing about the end steps.
> That's really interesting to us.
> If you've got theories, you can share them with us on Puzzle Cards.
> We love seeing what's in your brains.

## Hint #14 Text

> You may have gotten a hint from Trips by Boat.
> That's an important one. You will probably need that.
> And one other.
> There's another instruction in the captions of the Trip pictures.
> Find that instruction and you'll have a clear route to the million.

## Analysis

### Key Takeaways

1. **Trips by Boat has an important hint** — the Boat page text/instructions contain a critical clue
2. **"And one other"** — there's a SECOND instruction somewhere
3. **"In the captions of the Trip pictures"** — the individual trip/puzzle images on beast.travel have CAPTIONS with instructions
4. **These two instructions together = "a clear route to the million"**

### Action Required

- Scrape beast.travel Boat page for the hint/instruction
- Check ALL trip picture captions on Car, Horse, Plane pages — there's an instruction hidden in them
- The Boat page instruction + Trip caption instruction = how to assemble the final answer

### What We Know About the Boat Page

From our Feb 23 scrape, the Boat page has:
> "These are all the destinations served by Beast Travel, in all stages of our travelers' journeys. Names of locations are given in the format of city then country, except in the United States and Canada, where state, province, or territory is used instead of country."

And the rhyme:
> "You can fill in all the spaces / And take a boat to all these places / You'll find our transports shown within / They'll give you all you need to win"
