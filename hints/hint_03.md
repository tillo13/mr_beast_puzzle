## Progress Update (Feb 11)

**Want some indication of progress?**

On Reddit, Slack, Discord, and anywhere else public that you've been working, we've been checking in on everything you've solved.

**We've seen a whole lot of stuff get crushed by giant groups of solvers.**

**So it's time to start adjusting what you can see.**

## The Actual Hint #3

### Stage 0 → Stage 1 Answer Type

We've told you about some of the main parts of this first stage:
Sunday's commercial and the bank video. You also know about the video playlist.

**As you've probably started to see, the 9 playlist puzzles (what we call Stage 0) told you that all the puzzle answers in stage 1 are all of a certain type.**

**Keep that in mind: If you found a puzzle and your answer is not of that type, then you're not done with that puzzle.**

### 🔥 CRITICAL: Stage 1 Structure (50 Puzzles Total)

**Now we want to tell you about more:**

**The first place you should be looking is obviously this site, the Inside the Beast video, and our social posts.** If you find one, you can put it online so others can see.

**The second place is a group of gifts that Jimmy gave a number of his friends. Most of them look like this. You might find a poster of who got a gift somewhere.**

**The gifts all have answers of the same type as every other puzzle in stage one. But here's a thing:**

**All of their answers can be used to get another answer. You just have to figure out how.**

**Those are all the parts of stage 1.**

**Together they account for 50 puzzles.**

**50 answers of the same type.**

### Crossword = 51st Clue + Stage 2 Gateway

**But there's one other puzzle many of you already have: a crossword. That has a 51st clue of this type.**

**And it's starting to get a lot different.**

**Take another look at it.**

## Key Takeaways

1. **Stage 0 = 9 playlist puzzles** → establish the answer type for all Stage 1 puzzles
2. **Stage 1 = 50 puzzles** from:
   - mrbeast.salesforce.com (this site)
   - "Inside the Beast" video (likely rKg5OZNM1aU)
   - Social media posts
   - **Gifts Jimmy gave to friends** (new puzzle set!)
3. **All Stage 1 answers are of the same type** (determined by Stage 0)
4. **Gift answers combine** to produce another answer (meta-puzzle within Stage 1)
5. **Crossword = 51st clue** (separate from the 50)
6. **Crossword is "starting to get a lot different"** → Stage 2 transition is happening NOW
7. **Answer type validation**: If your answer isn't of "that type," you're not done with the puzzle

## CRITICAL Questions

- **What is the answer type?** (Stage 0 → Stage 1)
- **What are the gifts?** ("Most of them look like this" — visual reference on site?)
- **Who are Jimmy's friends?** (poster reference — need to find list of gift recipients)
- **How do gift answers combine?** (another extraction mechanism)
- **What does "a lot different" mean for crossword?** (clues filling in? New extraction?)
