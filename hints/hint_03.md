## Preamble: Progress Update

> **Want some indication of progress?**
>
> On Reddit, Slack, Discord, and anywhere else public that you've been working, we've been checking in on everything you've solved.
>
> **We've seen a whole lot of stuff get crushed by giant groups of solvers.**
>
> **So it's time to start adjusting what you can see.**

## HINT #3:

> We've told you about some of the main parts of this first stage: Sunday's commercial and the bank video. You also know about the video playlist.
>
> **As you've probably started to see, the 9 playlist puzzles (what we call Stage 0) told you that all the puzzle answers in stage 1 are all of a certain type.**
>
> **Keep that in mind: If you found a puzzle and your answer is not of that type, then you're not done with that puzzle.**
>
> **The first place you should be looking is obviously this site, the Inside the Beast video, and our social posts.** If you find one, you can put it online so others can see.
>
> **The second place is a group of gifts that Jimmy gave a number of his friends. Most of them look like this. You might find a poster of who got a gift somewhere.**
>
> **The gifts all have answers of the same type as every other puzzle in stage one. But here's a thing:**
>
> **All of their answers can be used to get another answer. You just have to figure out how.**
>
> **Those are all the parts of stage 1.**
>
> **Together they account for 50 puzzles.**
>
> **50 answers of the same type.**
>
> **But there's one other puzzle many of you already have: a crossword. That has a 51st clue of this type.**
>
> **And it's starting to get a lot different.**
>
> **Take another look at it.**

## Key Takeaways

1. **Stage 0 = 9 playlist puzzles** → establish the answer type for all Stage 1 puzzles
2. **Stage 1 = 50 puzzles** from: this site, Inside the Beast video, social posts, gifts to friends
3. **All Stage 1 answers are of the same type** (determined by Stage 0 — location names)
4. **Gift answers combine** to produce another answer (meta-puzzle within Stage 1)
5. **Crossword = 51st clue** (separate from the 50)
6. **Crossword is "starting to get a lot different"** → Stage 2 transition happening
7. **Answer type validation**: If your answer isn't of "that type," you're not done
