## Preamble

> WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING, DO MORE OF THAT
> If you think you're doing the thing you need to do to win the million, we have good news for you:
> Other people think you're doing the right thing too!
> That means you have competition.
> And they want a million dollars too.

## Hint #17 Text

> Yesterday we put Trips by Roamy up on Beast Travel.
> Trips by Roamy isn't a puzzle.
> It's a tool to organize your thoughts.
> It has groups of three blanks that you must fill in with information you've already gathered.
> No new information is required.
> The entries follow a very specific pattern, which we've reinforced today.
> Also, there's an example at the top of the page. Here's some more about it.
> Consider it part of your solution.
> You won't need to use the first part of it again, or the middle, but the last part shows up one more time in the list.

## Analysis

### Trips by Roamy Mechanics (OFFICIAL)

1. **NOT a puzzle** — it's an organizing tool
2. **Groups of three blanks** — each entry has 3 fields to fill in
3. **Information already gathered** — uses existing puzzle answers, no new solving needed
4. **"Very specific pattern"** — entries follow a consistent format
5. **"Reinforced today"** — the pattern was made clearer on Feb 25 (site updated)
6. **Example at the top** — first entry is pre-filled as a demonstration

### The Example Entry

> "Consider it part of your solution."
> - The example IS part of the answer, not just a demo
>
> "You won't need to use the first part of it again, or the middle, but the last part shows up one more time in the list."
> - The example has 3 parts: [FIRST] [MIDDLE] [LAST]
> - FIRST part = used only in the example (appears once)
> - MIDDLE part = used only in the example (appears once)
> - LAST part = appears again somewhere else in the list
> - This suggests: each entry = [something unique] [something unique] [something repeated]
> - Or: [12-letter word] [city] [country] where a country repeats?

### Possible Three-Blank Format

Given beast.travel structure, the three blanks could be:
- [Transport word (12-letter)] [City/Location] [Country]
- [Puzzle answer] [Location name] [Region/Category]
- [Word] [City] [Country] — with the example showing one country that appears again
