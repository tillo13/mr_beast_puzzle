## Key Takeaways

### 1. Stage 2 is Gated on Puzzle Card Submissions

They're explicitly asking players to:
- Create a Puzzle Card for every solved puzzle
- Submit an answer in each card
- Chat with Slackbot in each card

**Why:** "That'll tell us what you're aware of and what you're not. Then we'll know what to send your way."

This confirms the adaptive puzzle theory — they're monitoring player progress and gating the next stage based on what the community has demonstrated solving.

### 2. Social Media Pages Contain Clues

Three companies' social pages to monitor:
- **MrBeast** — YouTube, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok
- **Salesforce** — X/Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, YouTube
- **Lone Shark Games** — X/Twitter, website, Discord

"We like putting clues in what we talk about there" — clues are embedded in their regular social media posts.

### 3. "About Ready for the Next Stage"

"We think you folks are about ready for the next stage to start. But we don't know that."

This suggests Stage 2 is imminent but depends on community readiness (measured by Puzzle Card submissions).
