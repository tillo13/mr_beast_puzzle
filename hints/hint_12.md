## Analysis

### Key Takeaways

1. **51 Stage 1 + 40 Stage 2 = 91 total location puzzles** — all location-type answers are now available
2. **Trips by Boat = endgame assembly tool** — "where you can assemble your entire itinerary"
3. **"One final thing"** after the 91 locations = the Boat page itself
4. **"Work together. Draw up a plan."** = Boat page is collaborative; likely a fill-in puzzle
5. **Hello Puzzlers livestream** (Feb 20) — may contain additional intel

### Beast Travel Math

- Stage 1: 51 puzzles (was 50 in Hint #8 — one extra, likely the Sudoku location)
- Stage 2: 40 puzzles (15 Car + 9 Horse + 16 Plane on beast.travel)
- Total: 91 location answers
- Plus Boat page = final assembly mechanism
