## Key Revelations

### 1. ALL Stage 1 Clues Are Out

"All the clues for stage 1 are out" — no more waiting for new releases.

### 2. Complete Puzzle Inventory (60 total!)

| Category | Count | Description | Our Status |
|----------|-------|-------------|-----------|
| Stage 0 playlist | 9 | On the YouTube playlist | SOLVED (9 words) |
| Playlist setup | 1 | "Sets up the playlist" | **IDENTIFIED** — Pokemon crossword (Clue 006), blue intersection letters spell "SOLUTION IS LOCATION". Beastbot confirmed: "There is a puzzle that gets you to the playlist" + "This bank video puzzle goes with screen 12" (10^5=100,000) |
| Commercial puzzles | 12 | "Entirely in Sunday's commercial" | Partially found (monitors, lasers, etc.) |
| Bank video puzzles | 12 | "Each goes with one of the screens" | Partially found |
| Gift puzzles | 10 | "Gifts given out to our friends" | UNKNOWN — need gift poster |
| Gift unifier | 1 | "The 1 puzzle that unites them" | UNKNOWN — meta-puzzle for gifts |
| YouTube shorts | 2 | "Not related to the gifts" | UNKNOWN — which shorts? |
| Site/Salesforce socials | 9 | "On this site or social posts from Salesforce" | UNKNOWN — need to check |
| Lone Shark socials | 3 | "On Lone Shark's socials" | UNKNOWN — need to check |
| Crossword | 1 | "Sets up stage 2" | IN PROGRESS |
| **TOTAL** | **60** | | |

Wait — that's 60 puzzles, not 50! Hint #3 said 50 Stage 1 puzzles. Now we have 9 Stage 0 + 51 others = 60 total. Or 50 Stage 1 + 9 Stage 0 + 1 crossword = 60.

### 3. CRITICAL: "These answers do not match the others. IYKYK."

Stage 0 answers (EVERY, CHALLENGE, LEADS, etc.) are NOT the same type as Stage 1 answers. "IYKYK" = "If You Know, You Know" — the meta-clue told us all Stage 1 answers are LOCATION NAMES. The Stage 0 answers are generic words, not locations.

### 4. NEW puzzle categories we didn't know about:

- **1 puzzle that sets up the playlist** — **IDENTIFIED (Feb 15):** Pokemon crossword (milliondollarpuzzlewiki Clue 006). Blue letters at intersection points spell "SOLUTION IS LOCATION." Beastbot says it pairs with Screen 12 (10^5) in the ad and is a bank video puzzle.
- **12 puzzles entirely in the commercial** — We found some monitors/symbols but not 12 distinct puzzles
- **2 YouTube shorts** — Need to find these
- **9 on site/Salesforce socials** — Need to scan Salesforce social pages
- **3 on Lone Shark socials** — Need to check lonesharkgames.com, their X/Twitter, etc.

### 5. Card Submissions Are Working

"We've enjoyed seeing your guesses on your puzzle cards" — they're reading them!
"It'll be worth your effort" — cards unlock something
"It is a key to what happens next" — CRITICAL for Stage 2 activation
