**Source:** mrbeast.salesforce.com (OFFICIAL)

## Preamble (NOT part of the hint number)

> BEAST TRAVEL IS LAUNCHING A LOYALTY PROGRAM
> When you solve puzzles, we give you puzzles.
> Beast Travel is no exception.
> Feel good you're making progress on stage 2. You're in it.
> More today, likely more tomorrow, if you keep at it.
> Because Roamy the Globe cares.

## Hint #9 Text

> Speaking of the number 9, we said there were 9 puzzles on this site or social posts from Salesforce properties.
> These are not connected to the commercials or these hints. They're in these places:
>
> 4 are in **Behind the Scenes** videos. 2 of those are underwater. 1 is in pieces. 1 never forgets.
>
> 3 are on **large physical objects**. You can see them on **Salesforce's X feed**. 1 may take a while to watch.
>
> 2 are on **this site**. 1 is in a helpful video. The other follows our advice.
>
> If you haven't found those, find those.

## Analysis

### Beast Travel Loyalty Program
- "When you solve puzzles, we give you puzzles" — solving beast.travel puzzles UNLOCKS MORE puzzles
- "More today, likely more tomorrow" — beast.travel is being updated dynamically
- **"Roamy the Globe"** — a character/mascot. ROAMY is an anagram of MORAY (a type of eel). Slackbot previously noted "ROAMY → MAYOR, MORAY" as anagrams.
- Need to check beast.travel for new content

### The 9 Site/Social Puzzles (from Hint #6 inventory)
These are the "9 puzzles in this site or social posts from Salesforce properties" — NOT connected to commercials or hints.

**Group 1: 4 in Behind the Scenes videos**
- 2 are "underwater" — submarine video? underwater scenes?
- 1 is "in pieces" — jigsaw? fragmented?
- 1 "never forgets" — elephant! (matches elephant monitor symbol, 85673 code)

**Group 2: 3 on large physical objects (Salesforce's X feed)**
- Visible on Salesforce's X (Twitter) feed
- 1 "may take a while to watch" — long video? time-lapse? billboard?
- "Large physical objects" = billboards, building wraps, installations, vehicles?

**Group 3: 2 on this site (mrbeast.salesforce.com)**
- 1 is in "a helpful video" — the How to Play video? BTS video embedded on site?
- 1 "follows our advice" — something that follows instructions given in hints?

### Cross-References
- Hint #6 listed: "9 puzzles in this site or social posts from Salesforce properties"
- These are SEPARATE from the 12 commercial puzzles and 12 bank video puzzles
- "If you haven't found those, find those" = these are solvable NOW, not future content

### Key Questions for Slackbot
1. What is the Beast Travel loyalty program? What new content appeared?
2. Who/what is "Roamy the Globe"?
3. Which BTS videos have underwater content?
4. What are the "large physical objects" on Salesforce's X feed?
5. Which video on the site is "helpful"?
6. What does "follows our advice" mean?
