## Hint #9 Text

> Speaking of the number 9, we said there were 9 puzzles on this site or social posts from Salesforce properties.
> These are not connected to the commercials or these hints. They're in these places:
>
> 4 are in **Behind the Scenes** videos. 2 of those are underwater. 1 is in pieces. 1 never forgets.
>
> 3 are on **large physical objects**. You can see them on **Salesforce's X feed**. 1 may take a while to watch.
>
> 2 are on **this site**. 1 is in a helpful video. The other follows our advice.
>
> If you haven't found those, find those.
