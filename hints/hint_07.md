## Preamble

> FEB 15
> PUZZLES ARE COMMUNITY EFFORTS
> A lot of our puzzles are easy to find.
> Others are quite hidden.
> If you're looking at a thing you think is a puzzle, but can't find what you're looking for, you should ask a friend.
> Beastbot may know, but also some of your fellow humans do.
> And for certain puzzles, you need a few more.

## HINT #7:

> One clue tells you to inquire with Slackbot about a specific kind of number puzzle.
>
> If you do that in a Puzzle Card, you'll get a place to look.
>
> But you'll always get the same one.
>
> You need friends for this puzzle.
>
> Maybe a million of them.

## Analysis

### Mechanism (step by step):
1. **A clue exists** (crossword or Stage 1 puzzle) that names a specific type of number puzzle and tells you to ask Slackbot about it
2. **Ask Slackbot about that number puzzle type** in a Puzzle Card → Slackbot gives you "a place to look" (a location)
3. **The answer is deterministic** — "you'll always get the same one" (same place every time, every player)
4. **The puzzle at that location requires massive collaboration** — "maybe a million" friends

### Key observations:
- "A specific kind of number puzzle" — Sudoku? Kakuro? KenKen? Nonogram? The clue specifies which one
- "You'll always get the same one" — Slackbot's response is fixed, not personalized
- "Maybe a million of them" — Classic MrBeast scale; puzzle likely requires crowdsourcing across his subscriber base
- Preamble mentions Beastbot AND "fellow humans" — some puzzles need both AI hints and community help

### What we don't know:
- Which clue references the number puzzle (not in the 48 revealed crossword clues as of Feb 15)
- Which type of number puzzle it is
- What "a place to look" means (URL? physical location? section of the site?)
- How "a million friends" factor in (each contributes a piece? collective action needed?)

### Action items:
- [ ] Try asking Slackbot about known number puzzle types (Sudoku, Kakuro, KenKen, Nonogram) in fresh Puzzle Cards
- [ ] Check community (Reddit, Discord, Google Doc) for reactions to this hint
- [ ] Monitor for new crossword clue reveals — the clue naming the number puzzle may not be visible yet
- [ ] Review the 60 Stage 1 puzzles for any that reference number puzzles
